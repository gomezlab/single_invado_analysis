Sample data is located on Balder, outside the svn repository in this directory:

/Volumes/Data/projects/focal_adhesions/data
/Volumes/Data/projects/focal_adhesions/results

This main folder, 'focal_adhesions', is also a checked out copy of the repository.

Most of the script defaults (which can be changed as needed) assume that the data lives in a 'data' directory and that results live in a 'results' directory. Both in the project root folder, typically 'focal_adhesions'

The data set can be synchronized from balder, using the scripts in the 'src/scripts' directory.
