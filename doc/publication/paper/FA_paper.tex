\section*{Abstract}

Focal adhesions are macromolecular complexes that provide a linkage from a cell
to its external environment. In a motile cell they form, enlarge, and
disassemble; these processes are essential to and govern cell migration. To
better understand the dynamic regulation of focal adhesions during cell motility
we have developed software for the automated detection, tracking, and data
extraction of these structures using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence
Microscopy (TIR-FM) image sets of fluorescently tagged adhesion components.
Utilizing this software we can generate high-content data sets that include the size, shape,
intensity, and position of every adhesion present in a living cell. Moreover these properties are followed over time to assess adhesion lifetime and
turnover rates. Here we apply this analysis to the adhesion component Paxillin in migrating NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We also show how a single point mutation
in Paxillin at the Jun-kinase phosphorylation site Serine 178 changes focal
adhesion size, distribution, and rate of assembly. We present this \textb{(freely available?)} software as a
generally applicable tool that will advance the understanding of how focal
adhesions are dynamically regulated in living cells (Note: may want to just say
that the sw is freely available).

\section*{Author Summary}

We have generated software that extracts high content information from TIR-FM
image sets of focal adhesions.  Using it we have identified phosphorylation of
Paxillin at Serine 178 as a key regulatory mechanism of adhesion assembly in
migrating cells.

\section*{Introduction}

Focal adhesions (FAs) are sophisticated protein complexes that play a central
role in cellular adhesion, motility, and survival. As points of integration for
both mechanical and chemical signaling, characterizing adhesion dynamics is
essential for understanding processes such as cell migration - a dynamic
multistep process requiring the continuous assembly and disassembly of
adhesions. In the course of cell movement lamellipodial protrusions are formed,
with new adhesions born at the cell edge, further assembled and then often
disassembled at the base of the protrusion. Other longer-lived adhesions are
disassembled within retractions that are formed in the tails of migrating cells.
In this and other FA-relevant processes, FA dynamics is recognized as being
highly regulated, with alterations in the balance of regulating factors playing
a key role in adhesion turnover essential for normal cell function.

Microscopic imaging of FAs has driven a significant portion of our current
understanding of adhesion dynamics, with methods such as total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) providing high-resolution images
capable of being quantitatively analyzed. However, challenges in image capture
and downstream analysis has generally led to the characterization of only a
relatively small number of hand-picked adhesions within any given cell
\cite{Webb2004} (\textbf{other example refs}). Recent technical and
methodological improvements have led to the automated detection and
characterization of focal adhesions for application in high-throughput screening
studies. For instance, Paran and colleagues have reported on the use of a
high-throughput high-resolution imaging system to screen a plant extract library
for effects on adhesion morphology and distribution. The same high-throughput
imaging system was used to perform multicolor analysis on various adhesion
components \cite{Zamir2008} and used in a siRNA screen against adhesion related
genes (\textbf{new Geiger paper in JCB}). In these instances, researchers were
able to obtain molecular signatures of protein components within focal
adhesions, resolve sub-domains within adhesions and identify clusters of genes
that had similar effects on focal adhesion morphology and placement. These
studies demonstrate the power of being able to identify and characterize all
adhesions present within a cell. However as these approaches rely on cell
fixation, critical aspects of focal adhesion biology, including spatiotemporal
adhesion dynamics, are lost.

Here we describe a novel system for the quantification of focal adhesion
spatiotemporal dynamics. This approach utilizes high-resolution (60x,
oil-immersion) time-series images of living cells generated with TIR-FM. Image
sequences are then processed through an analysis system that identifies each
individual adhesion, tracks their movement through time and collects associated
properties concerning the location, shape, size and intensity. As the birth,
lifetime and death of each adhesion is quantified in this approach, a thorough
picture of global adhesion behavior is captured.

To demonstrate the power of this approach, we focus on the molecular scaffold
protein paxillin, a core constituent of focal adhesions. Through direct
interactions with both structural and regulatory components, paxillin serves as
a platform for adhesion signal transduction. A principal regulatory mechanism of
paxillin is phosphorylation, with over 40 sites of phosphorylation currently
identified (\textbf{Horwitz JCS ref}). Many of these have yet to be
characterized, but those that have demonstrate strong effects on cell migration
(\textbf{refs}). One of these is the Jun-kinase (JNK) phosphorylation site
Serine 178 (S178). Mutation of this residue to Alanine, or inhibition of JNK
signaling, inhibits cell motility (\textbf{Jacobsen ref}). More recently, it has
been shown that phosphorylation of S178 enhances paxillin's interaction with FAK
and Tyrosine phosphorylation at residues 31 and 118 (\textbf{ref}). Expression
of the phosphomimetic Y31D/Y118D paxillin can rescue the S178A mutant phenotype.
This and related work hints that JNK phosphorylation of paxillin is an early
step in adhesion formation.

In this study we use our imaging analysis system to characterize FAs labeled
with EGFP-paxillin, generating high-resolution and high-content data sets of
adhesion distribution, morphology, and turnover in migrating NIH 3T3
fibroblasts. Results demonstrate that we can analyze adhesion spatiotemporal
properties in an unbiased manner, with typically $10^3-10^4$ adhesions analyzed
per cell. Utilizing wild-type paxillin as a baseline for comparison, we utilize
our software to detect alterations in adhesion spatiotemporal properties in
response to S178 mutation. Results demonstrate that the loss of this single
phosphorylation site affects adhesion site formation, size and assembly rates;
the large data sets generated in this work allowing subtle differences to be
detected at a significant level. We are also able to infer the existence of two
distinct spatial zones in which the process of either adhesion assembly or
disassembly is favored. (Comment from Eric on this sentence: I think we should
leave this out of the discussion for now until adhesions can be assigned to
specific protrusions. With distance from the nearest edge the only criteria,
assembly and disassembly may be occurring at different distances relative to the
edge, but in different parts of the cell (i.e. protruding edge and retracting
tail, which would NOT be considered overlapping).) These results further improve
our understanding of JNK regulation of paxillin dynamics as well as
demonstrating the utility of appropriately designed image analysis systems in
the characterization of high-content data sets.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Testing Data}

To test the capabilities of the FA analysis methods 

\subsection*{Quantitative Analysis of TIR-FM Images of Focal Adhesions}

To quantify aspects of focal adhesion spatiotemporal dynamic behavior, we
implemented a multistage image analysis pipeline (Figure~\ref{method_flow}).
Briefly, adhesions tagged with EGFP-paxillin are identified and segmented via a
watershed-like algorithm and the cell edge identified via a myristoylated  RFP
tag (see Methods).  At each consecutive time step both adhesion birth and death
events are identified and tagged by the software. Static properties of adhesions
identified within each image are quantified and include properties such as area
and position. Dynamic properties of adhesions, such as velocities and changes in
fluorescent intensity, are determined by tracking and measuring adhesion
properties across time steps/images. A summary of basic extracted and/or derived
FA properties is given in Table~\ref{prop_table}.

An example of the graphical output generated with this approach is shown in
Figure 2, where a single frame of an image time series is shown, with adhesions
identified through segmentation and highlighted (Panels A and B).
Superimposition of adhesions across all 198 image frames from this movie are
shown in Panel C.     

Distributions for several adhesion properties including area, average paxillin
intensity, axial ratio and distance from edge are shown in Panel D. In total,
properties for over 200,000 adhesions are represented in each histogram
(\textbf{Matt:} is this filtered data? The filter sets for each individual
histogram is are in the caption). While significantly larger adhesions occur,
adhesion areas are typically less than 0.14 $\mu m^2$ (mean of 0.59, median of
0.14).  The average paxillin intensity within adhesions follows a YYY (Poisson?)
distribution with mean intensity of XXX (Have to decide whether or not to
mention specific distributions). The gross shape of an adhesion, for instance by
FA axial ratios (major axis/minor axis) can also be characterized and we observe
that they tend to follow a YYY distribution(?) with a mean value of XXX.
Furthermore, we observe that adhesions are preferentially born within a region
beginning 2 microns from the cell edge and extending up to 10 $\mu m$ away. Of
the FA births observed, 65\% were born within this region (\textbf{Matt:} what
is the prob of birth in this region based on the histogram? Actually, is this
distance at birth or just the average distance of each adhesion from the edge? -
The plot is just of adhesion position without reference to adhesion lifecycle
events like birth or death. Those results are in the following figures).
(\textbf{Matt: something looks strange on the inset figure on longevity - the
x-axis is the same - is the y-axis reduced?} - Nope, there are relatively few
adhesions that live for 20 minutes or longer, note that the FA counts max out
around 80000 on the large longevity plot.) These results demonstrate that we are
able to identify and quantitatively characterize large numbers of adhesions,
allowing the unbiased assessment of FA behavior.

(Discuss longevity?...)

\subsection*{Dynamic Properties of FAs}
\subsubsection*{Kinetics of FA assembly and disassembly}
Of particular importance for understanding FA function is the assessment of
adhesion behavior through time, with or without perturbation. As an example,
Figure 3 shows the process of determining FA assembly and disassembly rates for
an individual adhesion as well as results for all adhesions within the 3T3 cells
of this study. In Figure 3A, an image series of a single adhesion (green)
progressing in 1-minute intervals from birth, through maturation and on to death
is shown.  This particular adhesion has a lifetime of 48 minutes. Using this
image time series, we quantify the normalized intensity of each adhesion, with
the intensity of this particular adhesion shown in 3B. Readily apparent are the
linear assembly and disassembly phases, indicated in green and red respectively.
In between these two phases we define a stable or stationary phase, shown in
yellow. As can be observed, a log-linear fit appears appropriate and has been
applied to the log intensity of the adhesion as shown in 3C. Approximately 92\%
of the variance is described by this linear approximation. Similarly, the rate
of disassembly for this adhesion is shown in Panel D and is again well described
by a linear approximation with 96\% of the variance explained.

As described previously, a major objective of earlier studies has been to
estimate the rate of FA assembly and disassembly under different conditions.
However, such rates have been defined through measurement of relatively small
numbers of adhesions, typically between 10-20 (\textbf{may want to put prev
sentence in discussion instead - or at least incorporate into discussion}). We
utilized our system to more broadly characterize the rates of FA assembly and
disassembly. We repeated the analysis detailed in Figure 3A-D on all ZZZ
adhesions found within 20 3T3 cells. To establish rates for ``ideal'' adhesions,
we focused on the analysis of FAs having lifetimes of at least 20 minutes and
having well-defined log-linear fits ($R^2 > 0.9$; Panel E). Filtering using this
$R^2$ criterion gave 303 adhesions with clearly definable assembly rates and
another 484 with similarly well-defined rates of disassembly. As can be seen,
the mean rate of assembly of 0.045 $min^{-1}$ (median 0.038) is 64\% greater
than that of disassembly, with mean rate of 0.027 $min^{-1}$ (median 0.024). The
observed variance in adhesion kinetics encompasses earlier published reports but
provides a much more comprehensive picture of the breadth of adhesion assembly
and disassembly dynamics.

\textbf{Probably need to better describe why this group of adhesions is
described and not the 1000's of others available. XX\% have linear fits with
$R^2 > yy$, etc. Should also state results for all data (unfiltered)} 

\subsubsection*{Spatial properties of FA assembly and disassembly}

Comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of this class of prototypical adhesions
allows the estimation of rates of assembly and disassembly. While this provides
a view of FA behavior as a function of time, spatial aspects of FA behavior and
dynamics can similarly be studied. Using the identical set of adhesions
identified in the previous paxillin kinetics analysis, we investigated the
spatial property of where adhesions tend to be born or die (Figure 4). As seen
in (A), the vast majority (~ 84\%) of these adhesions are born less than 5
microns from the cell edge. In contrast, adhesions tend to die further from the
edge with a mean value of 8.7 microns in these experiments (B). This suggests
the existence of two distinct, but partially overlapping "zones" within which
preferential birth or death of FAs occurs. When looking at both FA birth/death
location and assembly/disassembly rate simultaneously, we find that higher
assembly rates tend to be observed in births that occur near the edge while no
obvious effect of spatial location on the rate of disassembly is apparent. 


\subsection*{Paxillin S178A Mutant Perturbation}

We used mutation of serine 178 to alanine as a system perturbation. As discussed earlier, this
mutation blocks JNK phosphorylation of paxillin and has known alterations on
cell motility. However, effects on adhesion spatiotemporal dynamics have not
been well characterized.

We found that S178A mutants induced a number of significant effects on both
dynamic and spatial properties of adhesions. The most dramatic of these changes
is the approximately 40\% reduction in the rate of adhesion assembly as measured
by paxillin incorporation Figure \#A. This decrease in assembly rate is
significant with a p-value of less than $10^{-5}$. While not as large, we also
observe a small ($\sim$16\%) but statistically significant decrease in
disassembly rate ($p<10^{-3}$). Thus the kinetics of FA assembly is strongly
affected by this mutation, but in a non-symmetric manner.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[h]{c|c|c}
Property & Wild-type & S178A \\
\hline
Assembly Rate &0.045 (0.038) &0.027 (0.024)\\
Disassembly Rate &0.027 (0.024) &0.024 (0.021)\\
Edge Dist at Birth &3.54 (2.75) &5.21 (3.20)\\
Edge Dist at Death &8.65 (8.23) &8.73 (7.62)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{The numerical values of the properties displayed in the S178A
comparison figure, I thought we might want to have these values to refer to or
include in the text. The numbers are means, with the medians in parentheses.}
\end{table}

We previously observed that adhesions in WT cells have different distributions
of birth and death position relative to the cell edge. In comparison to WT
cells, we find that the distance from the edge at birth is greater by 44\% in
S178A cells (Figure \#C). While subtle in terms of physical displacement, this
statistically significant difference is detectable due to the large sample
number achieved with our automated computational approach. We also see a greater
variance in this measure in S178A cells. In contrast, there is no significant
difference between WT and mutant cells with regard to where an adhesion tends to
die, suggesting that spatial aspects of the disassembly process (i.e. where
disassembly occurs) is not dependent and/or sensitive to JNK phosphorylation at
this residue (Figure \#D).



\section*{Discussion}

We have described the development of a set of computational tools suitable for
assessing the results of perturbing the signaling networks which control FA
development. The S178A mutation was presented as case study for applying the
tools to analyzing complex FA phenotypes. The computational tools were used to
discover that the migration defects present in the S178A Paxillin mutant may be
caused by significant changes in the assembly and disassembly rates of FAs. In
addition, these changes in rates are accompanied by shifts in positions away
from the cell edge of FA birth and death. These changes indicate that Jun
Kinase's phosphorylation of Paxillin, exhibits strong controls on the entire FA
lifecycle.

The computational tools presented allow the entire lifecycle of FA to be
analyzed. Summary of tools...

The spatial properties of FA birth and death also paint an interesting picture,
that suggests that FA have distinct regions where assembly and disassembly
events are most concentrated. These assembly and disassembly regions overlap,
but remain distinct. The greatest concentration of assembly events appear to
occur approximately 1.5$\mu$m from the cell edge. The assembly event range
interestingly coincides with the end of the lamellipodia and the beginning of
the lamella, where the actin cytoskeletal network significantly changes.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Cell Culture}

NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (MEFs) and 293 LinXE ecotropic packaging cells were cultured
in 5\% CO$^2$ at 37$^\circ$C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Mediatech)
supplemented with 10\% fetal calf serum, 1\% L-Glutamine, and 1\%
penicillinstreptomycin. Fibroblasts were imaged in Ham's F-12K medium without
phenol red (SAFC Biosciences) with 2\% fetal bovine serum, 15mM HEPES, 1\%
L-Glutamine, and 1\% penicillinstreptomycin. 

To make stable cell lines, retroviral vectors were transfected into 293 LinXE
cells plated in 6cm dishes with Fugene 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
protocol (using 18$\mu$L Fugene 6 and 8$\mu$g of DNA). The media was replaced
after 12 hours. Viral supernatant was harvested 48 hours after media
replacement, passed through a .45$\mu$m syringe filter and then added to MEFs
plated at subconfluent densities at a ratio of 1:3 (viral supernatant/normal
media). Cells were simultaneously infected with virus containing myr-RFP and
the appropriate EGFP-Paxillin construct and went through 5-8 rounds of infection
to reach expression levels sufficient for live cell imaging.

\subsection*{Microscopy}

Prior to imaging, MEFs were plated onto coverslips coated with 5$\mu$g/mL
Fibronectin (Sigma) for 30min. Fibroblasts expressing EGFP-Pax$_{\textrm{S187A}}$
required 2-3 hours to adhere to the coverslips due to a spreading defect.
Immediately before being transferred to a sealed imaging chamber, complete
culture media was replaced with imaging media. 

Imaging was performed on an Olympus IX81 motorized inverted microscope equipped
with ZDC focus drift compensator and TIRFM illuminator, a 60X 1.45 NA PlanApoN
TIRFM objective, a cooled digital 12-bit CCD camera (CoolSnap, Roper
Scientific), a 100W Mercury arc lamp, and MetaMorph imaging software. The 488nm
laser line from a Krypton-Argon ion laser (Series 43, Omnichrome) was controlled
with a custom laser launch/AOTF (LSM Technologies).  

TIRF images of EGFP and epifluorescence images of RFP were acquired using an
80/20 (TIRF / Epifluorescence) splitter mirror, a custom dichoic mirror (Chroma)
and the following band-pass filters: EGFP (HQ 525/50); RFP (HQ580/30, HQ
630/40). Images were acquired with 2 x 2 binning. Illumination intensity was
controlled with either the AOTF (TIRF excitation) or neutral density filters
(epifluorescence excitation) until 300-1000ms exposures satisfied the dynamic
range of the camera without saturation. 

\subsection*{Image Processing}

Methods to identify the FA were adapted from a prior publication
\cite{Zamir1999}, with some modification. Briefly, each image taken during an
experiment was high pass filtered, using a round averaging filter with a radius
of 11 pixels (4.95 $\mu$m diameter). The high pass filtered images were
thresholded by an empirically determined value set to identify adhesion pixels.
The water segmentation method was used as described, but with the following
modifications. When a pixel acts as bridge between two large adhesions, where
large is defined as 40 or more pixels (1.85 $\mu$m$^2$), the bridge pixel is
assigned to the adhesion whose centroid is closest to the bridge pixel. Also,
following addition of all pixels whose high passed image value was above
threshold, pixels surrounded by adhesions were identified and added to adhesion
map using the same water algorithm. Between 200 and 600 adhesions were found in
each image from the experimental data. With each focal adhesion identified all
the collected images, many static adhesion properties are collected (Table
\ref{prop_table}).

Average local background fluorescence was subtracted from the average
fluorescence of each adhesion to give the background correct fluorescence
intensity. The local background region for a single adhesion was defined as the
region within 10 pixels of the adhesion border. Pixels outside the cell, inside
another another adhesion or the adhesion itself were excluded from the average
background fluorescence calculation.

The cell edges were found by analyzing the myr-RFP images using a method similar
to that described in a prior publication \cite{Machacek06}. Briefly, a histogram
of all the intensity values for a single image was collected and split into 1000
equal sized bins. The counts of each bins were then smoothed with the loess
algorithm \cite{Cleveland79} (polynomial order 2, 5\% of data included in each
fit) and the minima and maxima of the smoothed fit found. The maxima with the
highest value was identified and the set of minima at intensity values greater
than that the highest maxima collected. The intensity value of the minima
closest to the highest maxima in intensity was used as the binary threshold
cutoff for identifying the cell edge. Connected regions smaller than 10 pixels
were discarded and all the holes in the cell edge image filled.

\subsection*{FA Tracking}

With the focal adhesions identified in each image of the experimental data set,
another series of algorithms were designed to track the focal adhesions through
each sequential image. The tracking algorithm is based on a birth-death model of
a FA lifetime. In each sequential image a FA can either be born, continue into
the next time step, merge or die. The birth-death-merge processes are detected
by examining the properties extracted from the segmented adhesions. The results
of this tracking algorithm are assignments of the FA identified in each image
into lineages that track the development of the FA during the course of the
experiment.

The tracking algorithm is initialized with all the adhesions detected in the
first frame of the image sequence. The first step of the tracking algorithm
attempts to locate FA which correspond in the next time step of the experimental
data (Figure Supplemental Tracking Flow Chart). This first step assumes that if
a focal adhesion overlaps with a focal adhesion in the following frame, that
these overlapping adhesions correspond to one another. When an adhesion overlaps
with more than one adhesion in the following frame, the adhesion with the
greatest percentage of overlap is assigned as the match in the next frame. If a
FA does not overlap with any of the FA in the following image, the FA closest to
that adhesion in terms of the euclidean distance between each adhesion's
centroid is assigned as a match. Adhesions in the next frame that are not
selected via either of these methods, but still overlap with an adhesion in the
current frame are marked as being created via a split birth event. Adhesion
births that are the result of split events are dealt with in later filtering
steps. All of the living focal adhesions are assigned a corresponding FA in the
following image by these two rules.

This process of assigning live adhesions to corresponding adhesions in the
following frame produces sets of adhesions that are predicted to merge. Some of
these merge events are true merge events where one adhesion has joined with
another, while others are adhesions which die, but are erroneously assigned as
merge events. When a FA does not overlap with the FA it is predicted to become,
this FA is assumed to have died and its lineage is ended. These adhesions are
also marked as having undergone a death, which will be used in later filtering
steps. For the remaining merge events where more than one adhesion has been
predicted to merge in the next frame, one of the merging FA lineages is selected
to continue, while the other FA lineage is predicted to end. When the adhesions
predicted to merge differ in size by at least 10\%, the larger adhesion's
lineage is continued. If the merging FAs sizes do not differ by at least 10\%,
the lineage whose current centroid is closer to the adhesion centroid in the
following image is predicted to continue. By this sequences of rules, each merge
event is resolved so that corresponding FA in adjacent experimental data images
are collected.

Following tracking live adhesions and resolving the merge and death events,
there remain FA in the following image which are not assigned to any of the
current lineages. The unassociated FA are assigned into new lineages. This
process of tracking the live adhesions, resolving merge and death events and
starting new lineages is repeated for each image in the experimental data
sequence until adhesion data from all the images has been included.

\subsection*{Calculating Assembly and Disassembly Rates}

With the adhesions tracked through each experiment, the static properties
determined for each adhesion in each frame of the time-lapse movie can be
collected into a set of time series representing the properties of each adhesion
through time. One type of time series follows the mean intensity of Paxillin
through time, making it possible to estimate the rates of assembly and
disassembly of Paxillin for each adhesion. An automated method to estimate the
rates of assembly and disassembly was developed. This program automatically fits
linear models to the log-transformed time series of Paxillin intensity values
for both the assembly and disassembly phases of the FA life cycle. 

In the first part of the algorithm, linear models are fit to all the possible
assembly and disassembly phases of at least a user specified length. The
assembly phase is assumed to occur at the beginning of the time series, whereas
the disassembly phase is assumed to end with the last point in the time series.
Each of the fits collected were normalized by the either first or last point in
the time series and log-transformed, as described \cite{Webb2004}.

In the second part of the algorithm, the optimum lengths of the assembly and
disassembly phases were determined via a simple search for the maximum sum of
adjusted R$^2$ values for the fits. It was assumed that the assembly and
disassembly phases did not overlap. In the rare cases where there are multiple
combinations of assembly and disassembly times that produce the highest sum of
adjusted R$^2$ values, the combination with the longest combined assembly and
disassembly times is selected.

\subsection*{Results Filtering}

Several filters are used to analyze the data sets collected with these analysis
methods. When determining the assembly and disassembly rates, only adhesions
with at least 20 Paxillin intensity time points were analyzed. This ensured that
there was sufficient data available to correctly detect assembly and disassembly
rates. Adhesions whose birth was the result of a split event were also excluded
from the assembly rate calculations, while adhesions whose lineage ended with a
merge event were excluded from the disassembly rate calculation. Assembly and
disassembly fits whose linear model p-values were above 0.05 were also excluded
from the data set. Several figures only include data from the assembly or
disassembly fits whose linear models fit with an R$^2$ value of 0.9 or greater.

A separate set of filters were used to compile the stability phase of the
adhesion lifetime data. In order to estimate the length of time an adhesion
spends in the stability phase, both the assembly and disassembly phases have to
be observed. There are few adhesions where both the assembly and disassembly
phases fit log-linear models with high R$^2$ values (above 0.9), so the
R$^2$ value requirements were excluded, but the filter did exclude adhesions
were either the assembly or disassembly p-value was above 0.05.

\subsection*{Simulated Data}

To test the algorithm's ability to detect adhesion structures, track their
movement and extract their kinetic properties. A series of gold standard set of
simulated data was created. These simulated experiments fell into three classes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Stationary: designed to test the image processing algorithm's ability
	to detect, track and measure adhesions that are not moving
	\item Moving: designed to test the tracking algorithm's ability to follow
	adhesions of various sizes as they move
	\item Kinetics: designed to test the assembly and disassembly phase length
	and rate detection algorithms
\end{itemize}

All of the adhesions in the simulation were round in shape, with radii varying
between 1 to 10 pixels. The background noise values were distributed with mean 0
and variance $5*10^{-5}$.

\subsubsection*{Stationary Simulation}

The stationary simulation consisted of an array of round adhesions situated on a
noisy background. The adhesion intensities were varied between 0.05 and 0.47,
in order to cover a wide range of detected adhesion intensities (the
10$^\text{th}$ and 90$^\text{th}$ percentiles of average adhesion intensity is
0.23 and 0.47 on the 0 to 1 normalized scale). The range of simulated adhesion
intensities were evenly sampled to make 15 columns of adhesions, while each row
contained adhesions of a single size.

\subsubsection*{Moving Simulation}

The moving simulation used the same set of parameters as the stationary
simulation except that the adhesions were shifted across the imaging field at
varying rates.
