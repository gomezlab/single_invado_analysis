	Abstract = {The light microscope has long been used to document the localization of fluorescent molecules in cell biology research. With advances in digital cameras and the discovery and development of genetically encoded fluorophores, there has been a huge increase in the use of fluorescence microscopy to quantify spatial and temporal measurements of fluorescent molecules in biological specimens. Whether simply comparing the relative intensities of two fluorescent specimens, or using advanced techniques like Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), quantitation of fluorescence requires a thorough understanding of the limitations of and proper use of the different components of the imaging system. Here, I focus on the parameters of digital image acquisition that affect the accuracy and precision of quantitative fluorescence microscopy measurements. },

	Abstract = {Diverse cellular processes are carried out by distinct integrin-mediated adhesions. Cell spreading and migration are driven by focal complexes; robust adhesion to the extracellular matrix by focal adhesions; and matrix remodeling by fibrillar adhesions. The mechanism(s) regulating the spatio-temporal distribution and dynamics of the three types of adhesion are unknown. Here, we combine live-cell imaging, labeling with phosphospecific-antibodies and overexpression of a novel tyrosine phosphomimetic mutant of paxillin, to demonstrate that the modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin regulates both the assembly and turnover of adhesion sites. Moreover, phosphorylated paxillin enhanced lamellipodial protrusions, whereas non-phosphorylated paxillin was essential for fibrillar adhesion formation and for fibronectin fibrillogenesis. We further show that focal adhesion kinase preferentially interacted with the tyrosine phosphomimetic paxillin and its recruitment is implicated in high turnover of focal complexes and translocation of focal adhesions. We created a mathematical model that recapitulates the salient features of the measured dynamics, and conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein paxillin functions as a major switch, regulating the adhesive phenotype of cells. },

@article{Amagasaki2006a,
	Abstract = {c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the mitogenactivated protein kinase family. It has become clear that JNK does not only have a role in induction of stress responses but also in processes such as cell movement. In this report we demonstrate that JNK activity is necessary for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced chemotaxis of primary foreskin fibroblasts and in other cell types. PDGF-BB stimulation was found to lead to activation of JNK with a maximum after 30 min. Inhibition of JNK reduced Ser178 phosphorylation of the focal adhesion component paxillin. Paxillin phosphorylation at this site has been shown to be involved in the dynamics of focal adhesions and consequently cell migration. Moreover, we observed localization of JNK to the actin-dense membrane ruffles induced by PDGF-BB stimulation both using immunofluorescence staining and green fluorescent protein-tagged JNK. This suggests a role for JNK at the leading edge of the cell compatible with a function in cell migration. Furthermore, we show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which has an established role in PDGF-stimulated cell migration, is necessary for PDGF-induced activation of JNK. In conclusion, JNK is a critical component downstream of PI 3-kinase that may be involved in PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis presumably by modulating the integrity of focal adhesions by phosphorylating its components. },

@article{Kimura2008a,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE. Migration of corneal epithelial cells plays an important role in healing of corneal epithelial wounds. The role of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), a member of the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases, in the intracellular signaling responsible for the migration of corneal epithelial cells during wound closure was examined.  METHODS. Scratch wounds were introduced into cultured monolayers of simian virus 40-transformed human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells in the absence or presence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125. The phosphorylation and localization of JNK and paxillin during wound closure were examined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. The effects of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for JNK and of a mutant form of paxillin on HCE cell migration were determined by transfection.  RESULTS. SP600125 inhibited wound healing in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Immunoblot analysis showed that wounding increased the phosphorylation of JNK and of paxillin on serine (Ser) 178 in a manner sensitive to SP600125. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that phosphorylated JNK colocalized with paxillin at focal adhesions formed by HCE cells at the wound margin and that SP600125 inhibited the formation of such adhesions. Expression of JNK siRNA or of a paxillin mutant in which Ser178 is replaced by alanine inhibited HCE cell migration during wound closure.  CONCLUSIONS. JNK regulates HCE cell migration by modulating the phosphorylation of paxillin and the consequent formation of focal adhesions. A JNK-paxillin signaling pathway may thus play an important role in corneal epithelial wound healing in vivo. },

@article{Smadja-Lamere2008a,
	Abstract = {The adenovirus type 2 Early Region 4 ORF4 (E4orf4) protein induces a caspase-independent death program in tumor cells involving changes in actin dynamics that are functionally linked to cell killing. Because an increase in myosin II-based contractility is needed for the death of E4orf4-expressing cells, we have proposed that alteration of cytoskeletal tension is part of the signals engaging the death pathway. Yet the mechanisms involved are poorly defined. Herein, we show that the Jun N-terminal kinase JNK is activated in part through a pathway involving Src, Rho, and ROCK (Rho kinase) and contributes to dysregulate adhesion dynamics and to kill cells in response to E4orf4. JNK supports the formation of atypically robust focal adhesions, which are bound to the assembly of the peculiar actomyosin network typifying E4orf4-induced cell death and which are required for driving nuclear condensation. Remarkably, the dramatic enlargement of focal adhesions, actin remodeling, and cell death all rely on paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-178, which is induced by E4orf4 in a JNK-dependent way. Furthermore, we found that Ser-178-paxillin phosphorylation is necessary to decrease adhesion turnover and to enhance the time residency of paxillin at focal adhesions, promoting its recruitment from an internal pool. Our results indicate that perturbation of tensional homeostasis by E4orf4 involves JNK-regulated changes in paxillin adhesion dynamics that are required to engage the death pathway. Moreover, our findings support a role for JNK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation in adhesion growth and stabilization during tension signaling. },

	Abstract = {Paxillin is a multi-domain scaffold protein that localizes to the intracellular surface of sites of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Through the interactions of its multiple protein-binding modules, many of which are regulated by phosphorylation, paxillin serves as a platform for the recruitment of numerous regulatory and structural proteins that together control the dynamic changes in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression that are necessary for cell migration and survival. In particular, paxillin plays a central role in coordinating the spatial and temporal action of the Rho family of small GTPases, which regulate the actin cytoskeleton, by recruiting an array of GTPase activator, suppressor and effector proteins to cell adhesions. When paxillin was first described 18 years ago, the amazing complexity of cell-adhesion organization, dynamics and signaling was yet to be realized. Herein we highlight our current understanding of how the multiple protein interactions of paxillin contribute to the coordination of cell-adhesion function. },

@article{MichaelKrauthammer10192004,
	Abstract = {A major challenge in human genetics is identifying the molecular basis of common heritable disorders. In contrast to rare single-gene diseases, multifactorial disorders are thought to arise from the combined effect of multiple gene variants, such that any single variant may have only a modest effect on disease susceptibility. We present a method to identify genes that may harbor a significant proportion of the genetic variation that predisposes individuals to a given multifactorial disorder. First, we perform an automated literature analysis that predicts physical interactions (edges) among candidate disease genes (seed nodes, selected on the basis of prior information) and other molecular entities. We derive models of molecular networks from this analysis and map the seed nodes to them. We then compute the graph-theoretic distance (the minimum number of edges that must be traversed) between the seed nodes and all other nodes in the network. We assume that nodes that are found in close proximity to multiple seed nodes are the best disease-related candidate genes. To evaluate this approach, we selected four seed genes, each with a proven role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The method performed well in predicting additional network nodes that match AD gene candidates identified manually by an expert. We also show that the method prioritizes among the seed nodes themselves, rejecting false-positive seeds that are derived from (noisy) whole-genome genetic-linkage scans. We propose that this strategy will provide a valuable means to bridge genetic and genomic knowledge in the search for genetic determinants of multifactorial disorders.

	Abstract = {Knowing when and where a given protein is activated within intact animals assists in elucidating its in vivo function. With the use of a genetically encoded A-probe (activation bioprobe), we revealed that Cdc42 guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) remains inactive within Drosophila embryos during the first two-thirds of embryogenesis. Within the central nervous system where Cdc42 activity first becomes up-regulated, individual neurons display patterns restricted to specific subcellular compartments. At both organismal and cellular levels, Cdc42's endogenous activation patterns in the wild type allow predictions of where loss-of-function phenotypes will emerge in cdc42/cdc42 mutants. Genetic tests support the importance of suppressing endogenous Cdc42 activities until needed. Thus, bioprobe-assisted analysis uncovers how ubiquitously expressed signaling proteins control cellular events through continual regulation of their activities within animals.

	Abstract = {Synthetic gene networks can be constructed to emulate digital circuits and devices, giving one the ability to program and design cells with some of the principles of modern computing, such as counting. A cellular counter would enable complex synthetic programming and a variety of biotechnology applications. Here, we report two complementary synthetic genetic counters in Escherichia coli that can count up to three induction events: the first, a riboregulated transcriptional cascade, and the second, a recombinase-based cascade of memory units. These modular devices permit counting of varied user-defined inputs over a range of frequencies and can be expanded to count higher numbers. },

@article{Behrens2009a,
	Abstract = {Neuroscientists are beginning to advance explanations of social behavior in terms of underlying brain mechanisms. Two distinct networks of brain regions have come to the fore. The first involves brain regions that are concerned with learning about reward and reinforcement. These same reward-related brain areas also mediate preferences that are social in nature even when no direct reward is expected. The second network focuses on regions active when a person must make estimates of another person's intentions. However, it has been difficult to determine the precise roles of individual brain regions within these networks or how activities in the two networks relate to one another. Some recent studies of reward-guided behavior have described brain activity in terms of formal mathematical models; these models can be extended to describe mechanisms that underlie complex social exchange. Such a mathematical formalism defines explicit mechanistic hypotheses about internal computations underlying regional brain activity, provides a framework in which to relate different types of activity and understand their contributions to behavior, and prescribes strategies for performing experiments under strong control. },

	Abstract = {Integrins are transmembrane cell-adhesion molecules that carry signals from the outside to the inside of the cell and vice versa. Like other cell surface receptors, integrins signal in response to ligand binding; however, events within the cell can also regulate the affinity of integrins for ligands. This feature is important in physiological situations such as those in blood, in which cells are always in close proximity to their ligands, yet cell-ligand interactions occur only after integrin activation in response to specific external cues. This review focuses on the mechanisms whereby two key proteins, talin and the kindlins, regulate integrin activation by binding the tails of integrin-{\{}beta{\}} subunits. },

	Abstract = {Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) has become a powerful tool for studying clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, due to difficulties in tracking and quantifying their heterogeneous dynamic behavior, detailed analyses have been restricted to a limited number of selected clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). To identify intermediates in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles and factors that regulate progression through these stages, we used particle-tracking software and statistical methods to establish an unbiased and complete inventory of all visible CCP trajectories. We identified three dynamically distinct CCP subpopulations: two short-lived subpopulations corresponding to aborted intermediates, and one longer-lived productive subpopulation. In a manner dependent on AP2 adaptor complexes, increasing cargo concentration significantly enhances the maturation efficiency of productive CCPs, but has only minor effects on their lifetimes. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of dynamin-2 GTPase and reintroduction of wild-type or mutant dynamin-1 revealed dynamin's role in controlling the turnover of abortive intermediates and the rate of CCP maturation. From these data, we infer the existence of an endocytic restriction or checkpoint, responsive to cargo and regulated by dynamin. },

@article{Huang2004a,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including Jun N-terminus kinase (JNK), p38 and Erk, play crucial roles in cell migration. JNK, for example, regulates cell migration by phosphorylating paxillin, DCX, Jun and microtubule-associated proteins. Studies of p38 show that this MAPK modulates migration by phosphorylating MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MAPKAP 2/3), which appears to be important for directionality of migration. Erk governs cell movement by phosphorylating myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), calpain or FAK. Thus, the different kinases in the MAPK family all seem able to regulate cell migration but by distinct mechanisms. },

	Abstract = {Proteomics seeks the systematic and comprehensive understanding of all aspects of proteins, and location proteomics is the relatively new subfield of proteomics concerned with the location of proteins within cells. This review provides a guide to the widening selection of methods for studying location proteomics and integrating the results into systems biology. Automated and objective methods for determining protein subcellular location have been described based on extracting numerical features from fluorescence microscope images and applying machine learning approaches to them. Systems to recognize all major protein subcellular location patterns in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional HeLa cell images with high accuracy (over 95% and 98%, respectively) have been built. The feasibility of objectively grouping proteins into subcellular location families, and in the process of discovering new subcellular patterns, has been demonstrated using cluster analysis of images from a library of randomly tagged protein clones. Generative models can be built to effectively capture and communicate the patterns in these families. While automated methods for high-resolution determination of subcellular location are now available, the task of applying these methods to all expressed proteins in many different cell types under many conditions represents a very significant challenge. },

@article{Nayal2006a,
	Abstract = {Continuous adhesion formation and disassembly (adhesion turnover) in the protrusions of migrating cells is regulated by unclear mechanisms. We show that p21-activated kinase (PAK)-induced phosphorylation of serine 273 in paxillin is a critical regulator of this turnover. Paxillin-S273 phosphorylation dramatically increases migration, protrusion, and adhesion turnover by increasing paxillin-GIT1 binding and promoting the localization of a GIT1-PIX-PAK signaling module near the leading edge. Mutants that interfere with the formation of this ternary module abrogate the effects of paxillin-S273 phosphorylation. PAK-dependent paxillin-S273 phosphorylation functions in a positive-feedback loop, as active PAK, active Rac, and myosin II activity are all downstream effectors of this turnover pathway. Finally, our studies led us to identify in highly motile cells a class of small adhesions that reside near the leading edge, turnover in 20-30 s, and resemble those seen with paxillin-S273 phosphorylation. These adhesions appear to be regulated by the GIT1-PIX-PAK module near the leading edge. },

	Abstract = {The basis of science is the hypothetico-deductive method and the recording of experiments in sufficient detail to enable reproducibility. We report the development of Robot Scientist "Adam," which advances the automation of both. Adam has autonomously generated functional genomics hypotheses about the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and experimentally tested these hypotheses by using laboratory automation. We have confirmed Adam's conclusions through manual experiments. To describe Adam's research, we have developed an ontology and logical language. The resulting formalization involves over 10,000 different research units in a nested treelike structure, 10 levels deep, that relates the 6.6 million biomass measurements to their logical description. This formalization describes how a machine contributed to scientific knowledge. },

	Abstract = {For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems. },

@article{Digman2009a,
	Abstract = {We describe a method to detect molecular complexes and measure their stoichiometry in living cells from simultaneous fluctuations of the fluorescence intensity in two image channels, each detecting a different kind of protein. The number and brightness (N\&B) analysis, namely, the use of the ratio between the variance and the average intensity to obtain the brightness of molecules, is extended to the cross-variance of the intensity fluctuations in two channels. We apply the cross-variance method to determine the stoichiometry of complexes containing paxillin and vinculin or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in disassembling adhesions in mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing FAK, vinculin, and paxillin-tagged with EGFP and mCherry. We found no complexes of these proteins in the cytoplasm away from the adhesions. However, at the adhesions, large aggregates leave, forming a hole, during their disassembly. This hole shows cross-correlation between FAK and paxillin and vinculin and paxillin. From the amplitude of the correlated fluctuations we determine the composition of the aggregates leaving the adhesions. These aggregates disassemble rapidly in the cytoplasm because large complexes are found only in very close proximity to the adhesions or at their borders. },

	Abstract = {We have synthesized a 582,970-base pair Mycoplasma genitalium genome. This synthetic genome, named M. genitalium JCVI-1.0, contains all the genes of wild-type M. genitalium G37 except MG408, which was disrupted by an antibiotic marker to block pathogenicity and to allow for selection. To identify the genome as synthetic, we inserted "watermarks" at intergenic sites known to tolerate transposon insertions. Overlapping "cassettes" of 5 to 7 kilobases (kb), assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, were joined by in vitro recombination to produce intermediate assemblies of approximately 24 kb, 72 kb ("1/8 genome"), and 144 kb ("1/4 genome"), which were all cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes in Escherichia coli. Most of these intermediate clones were sequenced, and clones of all four 1/4 genomes with the correct sequence were identified. The complete synthetic genome was assembled by transformation-associated recombination cloning in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, then isolated and sequenced. A clone with the correct sequence was identified. The methods described here will be generally useful for constructing large DNA molecules from chemically synthesized pieces and also from combinations of natural and synthetic DNA segments. },

Unlike typical special topics meetings, which bring together investigators in a defined field primarily to review recent progress, the purpose of this meeting was to promote cross-disciplinary interactions by introducing emerging methods on the one hand and important biological applications on the other. The goal was to turn live cell imaging from a "technique" used in cell biology into a new exploratory science that combines a number of research fields. },

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest in network research across the physical and social sciences. For social scientists, the theory of networks has been a gold mine, yielding explanations for social phenomena in a wide variety of disciplines from psychology to economics. Here, we review the kinds of things that social scientists have tried to explain using social network analysis and provide a nutshell description of the basic assumptions, goals, and explanatory mechanisms prevalent in the field. We hope to contribute to a dialogue among researchers from across the physical and social sciences who share a common interest in understanding the antecedents and consequences of network phenomena. },

@article{Jones2009a,
	Abstract = {Many biological pathways were first uncovered by identifying mutants with visible phenotypes and by scoring every sample in a screen via tedious and subjective visual inspection. Now, automated image analysis can effectively score many phenotypes. In practical application, customizing an image-analysis algorithm or finding a sufficient number of example cells to train a machine learning algorithm can be infeasible, particularly when positive control samples are not available and the phenotype of interest is rare. Here we present a supervised machine learning approach that uses iterative feedback to readily score multiple subtle and complex morphological phenotypes in high-throughput, image-based screens. First, automated cytological profiling extracts hundreds of numerical descriptors for every cell in every image. Next, the researcher generates a rule (i.e., classifier) to recognize cells with a phenotype of interest during a short, interactive training session using iterative feedback. Finally, all of the cells in the experiment are automatically classified and each sample is scored based on the presence of cells displaying the phenotype. By using this approach, we successfully scored images in RNA interference screens in 2 organisms for the prevalence of 15 diverse cellular morphologies, some of which were previously intractable. },

	Abstract = {A long-standing goal of biology is to map the behavior of all cells during vertebrate embryogenesis. We developed digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy and recorded nuclei localization and movement in entire wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos over the first 24 hours of development. Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides "digital embryos," that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis. We further derive a model of germ layer formation and show that the mesendoderm forms from one-third of the embryo's cells in a single event. Our digital embryos, with 55 million nucleus entries, are provided as a resource. },

@article{Brown2006a,
	Abstract = {Cell migration is regulated in part by the connection between the substratum and the actin cytoskeleton. However, the very large number of proteins involved in this linkage and their complex network of interactions make it difficult to assess their role in cell migration. We apply a novel image analysis tool, spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS), to quantify the directed movements of adhesion-related proteins and actin in protrusions of migrating cells. The STICS technique reveals protein dynamics even when protein densities are very low or very high, and works in the presence of large, static molecular complexes. Detailed protein velocity maps for actin and the adhesion-related proteins {\{}alpha{\}}-actinin, {\{}alpha{\}}5-integrin, talin, paxillin, vinculin and focal adhesion kinase are presented. The data show that there are differences in the efficiency of the linkage between integrin and actin among different cell types and on the same cell type grown on different substrate densities. We identify potential mechanisms that regulate efficiency of the linkage, or clutch, and identify two likely points of disconnect, one at the integrin and the other at {\{}alpha{\}}-actinin or actin. The data suggests that the efficiency of the linkage increases as actin and adhesions become more organized showing the importance of factors that regulate the efficiency in adhesion signaling and dynamics. },

@article{Chan2008a,
	Abstract = {Cells sense the environment's mechanical stiffness to control their own shape, migration, and fate. To better understand stiffness sensing, we constructed a stochastic model of the "motor-clutch" force transmission system, where molecular clutches link F-actin to the substrate and mechanically resist myosin-driven F-actin retrograde flow. The model predicts two distinct regimes: (i) "frictional slippage," with fast retrograde flow and low traction forces on stiff substrates and (ii) oscillatory "load-and-fail" dynamics, with slower retrograde flow and higher traction forces on soft substrates. We experimentally confirmed these model predictions in embryonic chick forebrain neurons by measuring the nanoscale dynamics of single-growth-cone filopodia. Furthermore, we experimentally observed a model-predicted switch in F-actin dynamics around an elastic modulus of 1 kilopascal. Thus, a motor-clutch system inherently senses and responds to the mechanical stiffness of the local environment. },

Moreover,  is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of  can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased  in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of . This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in . That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve  without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications. },

	Abstract = {Nuclear reprogramming describes a switch in gene expression of one kind of cell to that of another unrelated cell type. Early studies in frog cloning provided some of the first experimental evidence for reprogramming. Subsequent procedures included mammalian somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, induction of pluripotency by ectopic gene expression, and direct reprogramming. Through these methods it becomes possible to derive one kind of specialized cell (such as a brain cell) from another, more accessible, tissue (such as skin) in the same individual. This has potential applications for cell replacement without the immunosuppression treatments that are required when cells are transferred between genetically different individuals. This article provides some background to this field, a discussion of mechanisms and efficiency, and comments on prospects for future nuclear reprogramming research. },

@article{Gardel2008a,
	Abstract = {How focal adhesions (FAs) convert retrograde filamentous actin (F-actin) flow into traction stress on the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration is unknown. Using combined traction force and fluorescent speckle microscopy, we observed a robust biphasic relationship between F-actin speed and traction force. F-actin speed is inversely related to traction stress near the cell edge where FAs are formed and F-actin motion is rapid. In contrast, larger FAs where the F-actin speed is low are marked by a direct relationship between F-actin speed and traction stress. We found that the biphasic switch is determined by a threshold F-actin speed of 8-10 nm/s, independent of changes in FA protein density, age, stress magnitude, assembly/disassembly status, or subcellular position induced by pleiotropic perturbations to Rho family guanosine triphosphatase signaling and myosin II activity. Thus, F-actin speed is a fundamental regulator of traction force at FAs during cell migration. },

	Abstract = {In migrating cells, actin polymerization promotes protrusion of the leading edge, whereas actomyosin contractility powers net cell body translocation. Although they promote F-actin-dependent protrusions of the cell periphery upon adhesion to fibronectin (FN), Abl family kinases inhibit cell migration on FN. We provide evidence here that the Abl-related gene (Arg/Abl2) kinase inhibits fibroblast migration by attenuating actomyosin contractility and regulating focal adhesion dynamics. arg-/- fibroblasts migrate at faster average speeds than wild-type (wt) cells, whereas Arg re-expression in these cells slows migration. Surprisingly, the faster migrating arg-/- fibroblasts have more prominent F-actin stress fibers and focal adhesions and exhibit increased actomyosin contractility relative to wt cells. Interestingly, Arg requires distinct functional domains to inhibit focal adhesions and actomyosin contractility. The kinase domain-containing Arg N-terminal half can act through the RhoA inhibitor p190RhoGAP to attenuate stress fiber formation and cell contractility. However, Arg requires both its kinase activity and its cytoskeleton-binding C-terminal half to fully inhibit focal adhesions. Although focal adhesions do not turn over efficiently in the trailing edge of arg-/- cells, the increased contractility of arg-/- cells tears the adhesions from the substrate, allowing for the faster migration observed in these cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that Arg inhibits cell migration by restricting actomyosin contractility and regulating its coupling to the substrate through focal adhesions. },

	Abstract = {Why do seemingly identical cells respond differently to a drug? To address this, we studied the dynamics and variability of the protein response of human cancer cells to a chemotherapy drug, camptothecin. We present a dynamic-proteomics approach that measures the levels and locations of nearly 1000 different endogenously tagged proteins in individual living cells at high temporal resolution. All cells show rapid translocation of proteins specific to the drug mechanism, including the drug target (topoisomerase-1), and slower, wide-ranging temporal waves of protein degradation and accumulation. However, the cells differ in the behavior of a subset of proteins. We identify proteins whose dynamics differ widely between cells, in a way that corresponds to the outcomes--cell death or survival. This opens the way to understanding molecular responses to drugs in individual cells. },

@article{Albeck2008a,
	Abstract = {When exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a closely related death ligand and investigational therapeutic, cells enter a protracted period of variable duration in which only upstream initiator caspases are active. A subsequent and sudden transition marks activation of the downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. Thus, extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by an unusual variable-delay, snap-action switch that enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows, and experiments confirm, that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are all critical for snap-action control. },

	Abstract = {Background: In the absence of stimuli, most motile eukaryotic cells move by spontaneously coordinating cell deformation with cell movement in the absence of stimuli. Yet little is known about how cells change their own shape and how cells coordinate the deformation and movement. Here, we investigated the mechanism of spontaneous cell migration by using computational analyses. Methodology: We observed spontaneously migrating Dictyostelium cells in both a vegetative state (round cell shape and slow motion) and starved one (elongated cell shape and fast motion). We then extracted regular patterns of morphological dynamics and the pattern-dependent systematic coordination with filamentous actin (F-actin) and cell movement by statistical dynamic analyses. Conclusions/Significance: We found that Dictyostelium cells in both vegetative and starved states commonly organize their own shape into three ordered patterns, elongation, rotation, and oscillation, in the absence of external stimuli. Further, cells inactivated for PI3-kinase (PI3K) and/or PTEN did not show ordered patterns due to the lack of spatial control in pseudopodial formation in both the vegetative and starved states. We also found that spontaneous polarization was achieved in starved cells by asymmetric localization of PTEN and F-actin. This breaking of the symmetry of protein localization maintained the leading edge and considerably enhanced the persistence of directed migration, and overall random exploration was ensured by switching among the different ordered patterns. Our findings suggest that Dictyostelium cells spontaneously create the ordered patterns of cell shape mediated by PI3K/PTEN/F-actin and control the direction of cell movement by coordination with these patterns even in the absence of external stimuli. },

	Abstract = {Actin-based cell motility and force generation are central to immune response, tissue development, and cancer metastasis, and understanding actin cytoskeleton regulation is a major goal of cell biologists. Cell spreading is a commonly used model system for motility experiments -- spreading fibroblasts exhibit stereotypic, spatially-isotropic edge dynamics during a reproducible sequence of functional phases: 1) During early spreading, cells form initial contacts with the surface. 2) The middle spreading phase exhibits rapidly increasing attachment area. 3) Late spreading is characterized by periodic contractions and stable adhesions formation. While differences in cytoskeletal regulation between phases are known, a global analysis of the spatial and temporal coordination of motility and force generation is missing. Implementing improved algorithms for analyzing edge dynamics over the entire cell periphery, we observed that a single domain of homogeneous cytoskeletal dynamics dominated each of the three phases of spreading. These domains exhibited a unique combination of biophysical and biochemical parameters -- a motility module. Biophysical characterization of the motility modules revealed that the early phase was dominated by periodic, rapid membrane blebbing; the middle phase exhibited continuous protrusion with very low traction force generation; and the late phase was characterized by global periodic contractions and high force generation. Biochemically, each motility module exhibited a different distribution of the actin-related protein VASP, while inhibition of actin polymerization revealed different dependencies on barbed-end polymerization. In addition, our whole-cell analysis revealed that many cells exhibited heterogeneous combinations of motility modules in neighboring regions of the cell edge. Together, these observations support a model of motility in which regions of the cell edge exhibit one of a limited number of motility modules that, together, determine the overall motility function. Our data and algorithms are publicly available to encourage further exploration. },

	Abstract = {This paper demonstrates that teamwork in science increasingly spans university boundaries, a dramatic shift in knowledge production that generalizes across virtually all fields of science, engineering, and social science. Moreover, elite universities play a dominant role in this shift. By examining 4.2 million papers published over three decades, we found that multi-university collaborations (i) are the fastest growing type of authorship structure, (ii) produce the highest-impact papers when they include a top-tier university, and (iii) are increasingly stratified by in-group university rank. Despite the rising frequency of research that crosses university boundaries, the intensification of social stratification in multi-university collaborations suggests a concentration of the production of scientific knowledge in fewer rather than more centers of high-impact science. },

	Abstract = {Advances in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy have enabled us to directly observe dynamic cellular phenomena. Although the techniques themselves have promoted the understanding of dynamic cellular functions, the vast number of images acquired has generated a need for automated processing tools to extract statistical information. A problem underlying the analysis of time-lapse cell images is the lack of rigorous methods to extract morphodynamic properties. Here, we propose an algorithm called edge evolution tracking (EET) to quantify the relationship between local morphological changes and local fluorescence intensities around a cell edge using time-lapse microscopy images. This algorithm enables us to trace the local edge extension and contraction by defining subdivided edges and their corresponding positions in successive frames. Thus, this algorithm enables the investigation of cross-correlations between local morphological changes and local intensity of fluorescent signals by considering the time shifts. By applying EET to fluorescence resonance energy transfer images of the Rho-family GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, we examined the cross-correlation between the local area difference and GTPase activity. The calculated correlations changed with time-shifts as expected, but surprisingly, the peak of the correlation coefficients appeared with a 6--8 min time shift of morphological changes and preceded the Rac1 or Cdc42 activities. Our method enables the quantification of the dynamics of local morphological change and local protein activity and statistical investigation of the relationship between them by considering time shifts in the relationship. Thus, this algorithm extends the value of time-lapse imaging data to better understand dynamics of cellular function. },

	Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique used to measure the interaction between two molecules labeled with two different fluorophores (the donor and the acceptor) by the transfer of energy from the excited donor to the acceptor. In biological applications, this technique has become popular to qualitatively map protein-protein interactions, and in biophysical projects it is used as a quantitative measure for distances between a single donor and acceptor molecule. Numerous approaches can be found in the literature to quantify and map FRET, but the measures they provide are often difficult to interpret. We propose here a quantitative comparison of these methods by using a surface FRET system with controlled amounts of donor and acceptor fluorophores and controlled distances between them. We support the system with a Monte Carlo simulation of FRET, which provides reference values for the FRET efficiency under various experimental conditions. We validate a representative set of FRET efficiencies and indices calculated from the different methods with different experimental settings. Finally, we test their sensitivity and draw conclusions for the preparation of FRET experiments in more complex and less-controlled systems.

@article{Feinerman2008a,
	Abstract = {In T cells, the stochasticity of protein expression could contribute to the useful diversification of biological functions within a clonal population or interfere with accurate antigen discrimination. Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, we examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T cell activation. We found that the CD8 co-receptor fine-tunes activation thresholds, whereas the soluble hematopoietic phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) digitally regulates cell responsiveness. Stochastic variation in the expression of these proteins generates substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population of T cells, but co-regulation of CD8 and SHP-1 levels ultimately limits this very diversity. These findings reveal how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled manner. },

	Abstract = {The engineering of biological systems is anticipated to provide effective solutions to challenges that include energy and food production, environmental quality, and health and medicine. Our ability to transmit information to and from living systems, and to process and act on information inside cells, is critical to advancing the scale and complexity at which we can engineer, manipulate, and probe biological systems. We developed a general approach for assembling RNA devices that can execute higher-order cellular information processing operations from standard components. The engineered devices can function as logic gates (AND, NOR, NAND, or OR gates) and signal filters, and exhibit cooperativity. RNA devices process and transmit molecular inputs to targeted protein outputs, linking computation to gene expression and thus the potential to control cellular function. },

	Abstract = {Although the identity and interactions of signaling proteins have been studied in great detail, the complexity of signaling networks cannot be fully understood without elucidating the timing and location of activity of individual proteins. To do this, one needs a means for detecting and controlling specific signaling events. An attractive approach is to use light, both to report on and control signaling proteins in cells, because light can probe cells in real time with minimal damage. Although optical detection of signaling events has been successful for some time, the development of the means for optical control has accelerated only recently. Of particular interest is the development of chemically engineered proteins that are directly sensitive to light. },

	Abstract = {Dynamic actin network at the leading edge of the cell is linked to the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions (FAs), and at the same time it undergoes retrograde flow with different dynamics in two distinct zones: the lamellipodium (peripheral zone of fast flow), and the lamellum (zone of slow flow located between the lamellipodium and the cell body). Cell migration involves expansion of both the lamellipodium and the lamellum, as well as formation of new FAs, but it is largely unknown how the position of the boundary between the two flow zones is defined, and how FAs and actin flow mutually influence each other. We investigated dynamic relationship between focal adhesions and the boundary between the two flow zones in spreading cells. Nascent FAs first appeared in the lamellipodium. Within seconds after the formation of new FAs, the rate of actin flow decreased locally, and the lamellipodium/lamellum boundary advanced towards the new FAs. Blocking fast actin flow with cytochalasin D resulted in rapid dissolution of nascent FAs. In the absence of FAs (spreading on poly-L-lysine-coated surfaces) retrograde flow was uniform and the velocity transition was not observed. We conclude that formation of FAs depends on actin dynamics, and in its turn, affects the dynamics of actin flow by triggering transition from fast to slow flow. Extension of the cell edge thus proceeds through a cycle of lamellipodium protrusion, formation of new FAs, advance of the lamellum, and protrusion of the lamellipodium from the new base. },

	Abstract = {CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are widespread security measures on the World Wide Web that prevent automated programs from abusing online services. They do so by asking humans to perform a task that computers cannot yet perform, such as deciphering distorted characters. Our research explored whether such human effort can be channeled into a useful purpose: helping to digitize old printed material by asking users to decipher scanned words from books that computerized optical character recognition failed to recognize. We showed that this method can transcribe text with a word accuracy exceeding 99{\%}, matching the guarantee of professional human transcribers. Our apparatus is deployed in more than 40,000 Web sites and has transcribed over 440 million words. },

	Abstract = {The wide range of shapes that are seen in stationary animal cells is believed to be the result of an interplay between giant filamentous complexes - largely the microfilaments and microtubules - although how this is achieved is unknown. In a migrating cell these large elements are also important, but here I suggest an additional factor: the cell surface distribution of those molecules that attach the cell to the substratum. As an animal cell advances, the attachments it makes with the substratum necessarily move backwards with respect to the cell. A fresh supply of these attachments - usually integrin molecules - is required at the cell front so that new attachments can be made. This supply is believed to be provided by the endocytic cycle, which enables the collection of integrins and other molecules from elsewhere on the surface of the cell to be recirculated to the front end of the cell. The rate at which a particular integrin cycles will determine its distribution on the ventral surface of the cell and this, in turn, might help to determine the shape of the cell. I also propose that adhesion molecules that have a slow rate of cycling will produce a flattish phenotype, as seen in fibroblasts, whereas a more rapid cycling will lead to a more snail-like shape. In addition, this model suggests why membrane ruffling occurs and that large non-circulating surface molecules move towards the back of the cell where they might assist in detaching the back end of the cell. },

@article{Clark1998a,
	Abstract = {The organization of the actin cytoskeleton can be regulated by soluble factors that trigger signal transduction events involving the Rho family of GTPases. Since adhesive interactions are also capable of organizing the actin-based cytoskeleton, we examined the role of Cdc42-, Rac-, and Rho-dependent signaling pathways in regulating the cytoskeleton during integrin-mediated adhesion and cell spreading using dominant-inhibitory mutants of these GTPases. When Rat1 cells initially adhere to the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, punctate focal complexes form at the cell periphery. Concomitant with focal complex formation, we observed some phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src, which occurred independently of Rho family GTPases. However, subsequent phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin occurs in a Rho-dependent manner. Moreover, we found Rho dependence of the assembly of large focal adhesions from which actin stress fibers radiate. Initial adhesion to fibronectin also stimulates membrane ruffling; we show that this ruffling is independent of Rho but is dependent on both Cdc42 and Rac. Furthermore, we observed that Cdc42 controls the integrin-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and of Akt, a kinase whose activity has been demonstrated to be dependent on phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Since Rac-dependent membrane ruffling can be stimulated by PI 3-kinase, it appears that Cdc42, PI 3-kinase, and Rac lie on a distinct pathway that regulates adhesion-induced membrane ruffling. In contrast to the differential regulation of integrin-mediated signaling by Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, we observed that all three GTPases regulate cell spreading, an event that may indirectly control cellular architecture. Therefore, several separable signaling pathways regulated by different members of the Rho family of GTPases converge to control adhesion-dependent changes in the organization of the cytoskeleton, changes that regulate cell morphology and behavior.  Key words: integrins;  adhesion;  cytoskeleton;  Rho;  Cdc42 },

	Abstract = {Online journals promise to serve more information to more dispersed audiences and are more efficiently searched and recalled. But because they are used differently than print--scientists and scholars tend to search electronically and follow hyperlinks rather than browse or peruse--electronically available journals may portend an ironic change for science. Using a database of 34 million articles, their citations (1945 to 2005), and online availability (1998 to 2005), I show that as more journal issues came online, the articles referenced tended to be more recent, fewer journals and articles were cited, and more of those citations were to fewer journals and articles. The forced browsing of print archives may have stretched scientists and scholars to anchor findings deeply into past and present scholarship. Searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion, but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon. },

	Abstract = {Error bars commonly appear in figures in publications, but experimental biologists are often unsure how they should be used and interpreted. In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.

To exploit this opportunity, we have developed a system for automated cell lineage tracing during  embryogenesis, based on 3D, time-lapse imaging and automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously expressed histone--GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal microscope, the imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes at 1 μm apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms then automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell movements, divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities based on the canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our software, named , can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell stage in 25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors of automated lineaging can then be corrected in a few hours with a graphic interface that allows easy navigation of the images and the reported lineage tree. The system can be used to characterize lineage phenotypes of genes and/or extended to determine gene expression patterns in a living embryo at the single-cell level. We envision that this automation will make it practical to systematically decipher the developmental genes and pathways encoded in the genome of .

	Abstract = {Summary The small GTPases, Rab5 and Rac, are essential for endocytosis and actin remodeling, respectively. Coordination of these processes is critical to achieve spatial restriction of intracellular signaling, which is essential for a variety of polarized functions. Here, we show that clathrin- and Rab5-mediated endocytosis are required for the activation of Rac induced by motogenic stimuli. Rac activation occurs on early endosomes, where the RacGEF Tiam1 is also recruited. Subsequent recycling of Rac to the plasma membrane ensures localized signaling, leading to the formation of actin-based migratory protrusions. Thus, membrane trafficking of Rac is required for the spatial resolution of Rac-dependent motogenic signals. We further demonstrate that a Rab5-to-Rac circuitry controls the morphology of motile mammalian tumor cells and primordial germinal cells during zebrafish development, suggesting that this circuitry is relevant for the regulation of migratory programs in various cells, in both in vitro settings and whole organisms.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, the deluge of complicated molecular and cellular microscopic images creates compelling challenges for the image computing community. There has been an increasing focus on developing novel image processing, data mining, database, and visualization techniques to extract, compare, search, and manage the biological knowledge in these data-intensive problems. This emerging new area of bioinformatics can be called "bioimage informatics". This article reviews the advances of this field from several aspects, including applications, key techniques, available tools and resources. Application examples such as high-throughput/high-content phenotyping and atlas building for model organisms demonstrate the importance of bioimage informatics. The essential techniques to the success of these applications, such as bioimage feature identification, segmentation and tracking, registration, annotation, mining, image data management and visualization, are further summarized, along with a brief overview of the available bioimage databases, analysis tools, and other resources. },

	Abstract = {The ability to sense molecular tension is crucial for a wide array of cellular processes, including the detection of auditory stimuli, control of cell shape, and internalization and transport of membranes. We show that myosin I, a motor protein that has been implicated in powering key steps in these processes, dramatically alters its motile properties in response to tension. We measured the displacement generated by single myosin I molecules, and we determined the actin-attachment kinetics with varying tensions using an optical trap. The rate of myosin I detachment from actin decreases >75-fold under tension of 2 piconewtons or less, resulting in myosin I transitioning from a low (<0.2) to a high (>0.9) duty-ratio motor. This impressive tension sensitivity supports a role for myosin I as a molecular force sensor. },

	Abstract = {A simple negative feedback loop of interacting genes or proteins has the potential to generate sustained oscillations. However, many biological oscillators also have a positive feedback loop, raising the question of what advantages the extra loop imparts. Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant. },

@article{AliceNicolas07152008,
	Abstract = {Cell focal adhesions are micrometer-sized aggregates of proteins that anchor the cell to the extracellular matrix. Within the cell, these adhesions are connected to the contractile, actin cytoskeleton; this allows the adhesions to transmit forces to the surrounding matrix and makes the adhesion assembly sensitive to the rigidity of their environment. In this article, we predict the dynamics of focal adhesions as a function of the rigidity of the substrate. We generalize previous theories and include the fact that the dynamics of proteins that adsorb to adhesions are also driven by their coupling to cell contractility and the deformation of the matrix. We predict that adhesions reach a finite size that is proportional to the elastic compliance of the substrate, on a timescale that also scales with the compliance: focal adhesions quickly reach a relatively small, steady-state size on soft materials. However, their apparent sliding is not sensitive to the rigidity of the substrate. We also suggest some experimental probes of these ideas and discuss the nature of information that can be extracted from cell force microscopy on deformable substrates.

	Abstract = {To investigate the mechanisms by which adhesions form and disperse in migrating cells, we expressed {alpha}5 integrin, {alpha}-actinin, and paxillin as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions. All localized with their endogenous counterparts and did not perturb migration when expressed at moderate levels. {alpha}5-GFP also rescued the adhesive defects in CHO B2 cells, which are {alpha}5 integrin deficient. In ruffling cells, {alpha}5-GFP and {alpha}-actinin-GFP localized prominently at the leading edge in membrane protrusions. Of the three GFP fusion proteins that we examined, paxillin was the first component to appear visibly organized in protrusive regions of the cell. When a new protrusion formed, the paxillin appeared to remodel from older to newer adhesions at the leading edge. {alpha}-Actinin subsequently entered adhesions, which translocated toward the cell center, and inhibited paxillin turnover. The new adhesions formed from small foci of {alpha}-actinin-GFP and paxillin-GFP, which grew in size. Subsequently, {alpha}5 integrin entered the adhesions to form visible complexes, which served to stabilize the adhesions. {alpha}5-GFP also resided in endocytic vesicles that emanated from the leading edge of protrusions. Integrin vesicles at the cell rear moved toward the cell body. As cells migrated, {alpha}5 vesicles also moved from a perinuclear region to the base of the lamellipodium. The {alpha}5 vesicles colocalized with transferrin receptor and FM 4-64 dye. After adhesions broke down in the rear, {alpha}5-GFP was found in fibrous structures behind the cell, whereas {alpha}-actinin-GFP and paxillin-GFP moved up the lateral edge of retracting cells as organized structures and then dissipated.

	Abstract = {We recently reported on CFP-Epac-YFP, an Epac-based single polypeptide FRET reporter to resolve cAMP levels in living cells. In this study, we compared and optimized the fluorescent protein donor/acceptor pairs for use in biosensors such as CFP-Epac-YFP. Our strategy was to prepare a wide range of constructs consisting of different donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins separated by a short linker. Constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and tested for FRET and other relevant properties. The most promising pairs were subsequently used in an attempt to improve the FRET span of the Epac-based cAMP sensor. The results show significant albeit not perfect correlation between performance in the spacer construct and in the Epac sensor. Finally, this strategy enabled us to identify improved sensors both for detection by sensitized emission and by fluorescent lifetime imaging. The present overview should be helpful in guiding development of future FRET sensors. },

	Abstract = {Summary Cells exhibit a biphasic migration-velocity response to increasing adhesion strength, with fast migration occurring at intermediate extracellular matrix (ECM) concentration and slow migration occurring at low and high ECM concentration. A simple mechanical model has been proposed to explain this observation, in which too little adhesion does not provide sufficient traction whereas too much adhesion renders cells immobile. Here we characterize a phenotype for rapid cell migration, which in contrast to the previous model reveals a complex interdependence of subcellular systems that mediates optimal cell migration in response to increasing adhesion strength. The organization and activity of actin, myosin II, and focal adhesions (FAs) are spatially and temporally highly variable and do not exhibit a simple correlation with optimal motility rates. Furthermore, we can recapitulate rapid migration at a nonoptimal ECM concentration by manipulating myosin II activity. Thus, the interplay between actomyosin and FA dynamics results in a specific balance between adhesion and contraction, which induces maximal migration velocity.},

	Abstract = {Both tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 (pY14Cav1) and GlcNAc-transferase V (Mgat5) are linked with focal adhesions (FAs); however, their function in this context is unknown. Here, we show that galectin-3 binding to Mgat5-modified N-glycans functions together with pY14Cav1 to stabilize focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within FAs, and thereby promotes FA disassembly and turnover. Expression of the Mgat5/galectin lattice alone induces FAs and cell spreading. However, FAK stabilization in FAs also requires expression of pY14Cav1. In cells lacking the Mgat5/galectin lattice, pY14Cav1 is not sufficient to promote FAK stabilization, FA disassembly, and turnover. In human MDA-435 cancer cells, Cav1 expression, but not mutant Y14FCav1, stabilizes FAK exchange and stimulates de novo FA formation in protrusive cellular regions. Thus, transmembrane crosstalk between the galectin lattice and pY14Cav1 promotes FA turnover by stabilizing FAK within FAs defining previously unknown, interdependent roles for galectin-3 and pY14Cav1 in tumor cell migration.

@article{Angelique08,
	Abstract = { Cell migration is a highly integrated process where actin turnover, actomyosin contractility, and adhesion dynamics are all closely linked. In this paper, we propose a computational model investigating the coupling of these fundamental processes within the context of spontaneous (i.e. unstimulated) cell migration. In the unstimulated cell, membrane oscillations originating from the interaction between passive hydrostatic pressure and contractility are sufficient to lead to the formation of adhesion spots. Cell contractility then leads to the maturation of these adhesion spots into focal adhesions. Due to active actin polymerization, which reinforces protrusion at the leading edge, the traction force required for cell translocation can be generated. Computational simulations first show that the model hypotheses allow one to reproduce the main features of fibroblast cell migration and established results on the biphasic aspect of the cell speed as a function of adhesion strength. The model also demonstrates that certain temporal parameters, such as the adhesion proteins recycling time and adhesion lifetimes, influence cell motion patterns, particularly cell speed and persistence of the direction of migration. This study provides some elements, which allow a better understanding of spontaneous cell migration and enables a first glance at how an individual cell would potentially react once exposed to a stimulus.},

	Abstract = {The fibronectin receptors {alpha}51 integrin and syndecan-4 cocluster in focal adhesions and coordinate cell migration by making individual contributions to the suppression of RhoA activity during matrix engagement. p190Rho-guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP) is known to inhibit RhoA during the early stages of cell spreading in an Src-dependent manner. This paper dissects the mechanisms of p190RhoGAP regulation and distinguishes the contributions of {alpha}51 integrin and syndecan-4. Matrix-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP is stimulated solely by engagement of {alpha}51 integrin and is independent of syndecan-4. Parallel engagement of syndecan-4 causes redistribution of the tyrosine-phosphorylated pool of p190RhoGAP between membrane and cytosolic fractions by a mechanism that requires direct activation of protein kinase C {alpha} by syndecan-4. Activation of both pathways is necessary for the efficient regulation of RhoA and, as a consequence, focal adhesion formation. Accordingly, we identify p190RhoGAP as the convergence point for adhesive signals mediated by {alpha}51 integrin and syndecan-4. This molecular mechanism explains the cooperation between extracellular matrix receptors during cell adhesion.

	Abstract = {We investigate both theoretically and experimentally how stress is propagated through the actin cytoskeleton of adherent cells and consequentially distributed at sites of focal adhesions (FAs). The actin cytoskeleton is modeled as a two-dimensional cable network with different lattice geometries. Both prestrain, resulting from actomyosin contractility, and central application of external force, lead to finite forces at the FAs that are largely independent of the lattice geometry, but strongly depend on the exact spatial distribution of the FAs. The simulation results compare favorably with experiments with adherent fibroblasts onto which lateral force is exerted using a microfabricated pillar. For elliptical cells, central application of external force along the long axis leads to two large stress regions located obliquely opposite to the pulling direction. For elliptical cells pulled along the short axis as well as for circular cells, there is only one region of large stress opposite to the direction of pull. If in the computer simulations FAs are allowed to rupture under force for elliptically elongated and circular cell shapes, then morphologies arise which are typical for migrating fibroblasts and keratocytes, respectively. The same effect can be obtained also by internally generated force, suggesting a mechanism by which cells can control their migration morphologies.

	Abstract = {The {alpha}91 integrin accelerates cell migration through binding of spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT) to the {alpha}9 cytoplasmic domain. We now show that SSAT enhances {alpha}9-mediated migration specifically through catabolism of spermidine and/or spermine. Because spermine and spermidine are effective blockers of K+ ion efflux through inward-rectifier K+ (Kir) channels, we examined the involvement of Kir channels in this pathway. The Kir channel inhibitor, barium, or knockdown of a single subunit, Kir4.2, specifically inhibited {alpha}9-dependent cell migration. {alpha}91 and Kir4.2 colocalized in focal adhesions at the leading edge of migrating cells and inhibition or knockdown of Kir4.2 caused reduced persistence and an increased number of lamellipodial extensions in cells migrating on an {alpha}91 ligand. These results identify a pathway through which the {alpha}9 integrin subunit stimulates cell migration by localized polyamine catabolism and modulation of Kir channel function.

@article{LionelChristiaen06062008,
	Abstract = {Gene regulatory networks direct the progressive determination of cell fate during embryogenesis, but how they control cell behavior during morphogenesis remains largely elusive. Cell sorting, microarrays, and targeted molecular manipulations were used to analyze cardiac cell migration in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. The heart network regulates genes involved in most cellular activities required for migration, including adhesion, cell polarity, and membrane protrusions. We demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor signaling and the forkhead transcription factor FoxF directly upregulate the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoDF, which synergizes with Cdc42 to contribute to the protrusive activity of migrating cells. Moreover, RhoDF induces membrane protrusions independently of other cellular activities required for migration. We propose that transcription regulation of specific effector genes determines the coordinated deployment of discrete cellular modules underlying migration.

	Abstract = {Summary Capping protein (CP) is an integral component of Arp2/3-nucleated actin networks that drive amoeboid motility. Increasing the concentration of capping protein, which caps barbed ends of actin filaments and prevents elongation, increases the rate of actin-based motility in vivo and in vitro. We studied the synergy between CP and Arp2/3 using an in vitro actin-based motility system reconstituted from purified proteins. We find that capping protein increases the rate of motility by promoting more frequent filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex and not by increasing the rate of filament elongation as previously suggested. One consequence of this coupling between capping and nucleation is that, while the rate of motility depends strongly on the concentration†of CP and Arp2/3, the net rate of actin assembly is insensitive to changes in either factor. By reorganizing their architecture, dendritic actin networks harness the same assembly kinetics to drive different rates of motility.},

@article{MarkusSchober02262007,
	Abstract = {In response to {alpha}{beta}1 integrin signaling, transducers such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) become activated, relaying to specific machineries and triggering distinct cellular responses. By conditionally ablating Fak in skin epidermis and culturing Fak-null keratinocytes, we show that FAK is dispensable for epidermal adhesion and basement membrane assembly, both of which require {alpha}{beta}1 integrins. FAK is also dispensible for proliferation/survival in enriched medium. In contrast, FAK functions downstream of {alpha}{beta}1 integrin in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and orchestrating polarized keratinocyte migration out of epidermal explants. Fak-null keratinocytes display an aberrant actin cytoskeleton, which is tightly associated with robust, peripheral focal adhesions and microtubules. We find that without FAK, Src, p190RhoGAP, and PKL-PIX-PAK, localization and/or activation at focal adhesions are impaired, leading to elevated Rho activity, phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase, and enhanced tensile stress fibers. We show that, together, these FAK-dependent activities are critical to control the turnover of focal adhesions, which is perturbed in the absence of FAK.

	Abstract = {Abstract~~The motility of cells crawling on a substratum has its origin in a thin cell organ called lamella. We present a 2-dimensional continuum model for the lamella dynamics of a slowly migrating cell, such as a human keratinocyte. The central components of the model are the dynamics of a viscous cytoskeleton capable to produce contractile and swelling stresses, and the formation of adhesive bonds in the plasma cell membrane between the lamella cytoskeleton and adhesion sites at the substratum. We will demonstrate that a simple mechanistic model, neglecting the complicated signaling pathways and regulation processes of a living cell, is able to capture the most prominent aspects of the lamella dynamics, such as quasi-periodic protrusions and retractions of the moving tip, retrograde flow of the cytoskeleton and the related accumulation of focal adhesion complexes in the leading edge of a migrating cell. The developed modeling framework consists of a nonlinearly coupled system of hyperbolic, parabolic and ordinary differential equations for the various molecular concentrations, two elliptic equations for cytoskeleton velocity and hydrodynamic pressure in a highly viscous two-phase flow, with appropriate boundary conditions including equalities and inequalities at the moving boundary. In order to analyse this hybrid continuum model by numerical simulations for different biophysical scenarios, we use suitable finite element and finite volume schemes on a fixed triangulation in combination with an adaptive level set method describing the free boundary dynamics. },

@article{Meyers2006a,
	Abstract = {SummaryBackground In order for signals generated at the plasma membrane to reach intracellular targets, activated messengers, such as G proteins and phosphoproteins, must diffuse through the cytoplasm. If the deactivators of these messengers, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and phosphatases, respectively, are sufficiently active in the cytoplasm, then the signal could in principle decay before reaching the target and a stable spatial gradient in phosphostate would be generated. Recent experiments document the existence of such gradients in living cells and suggest a role for them in mitotic spindle morphogenesis and cell migration. However, how such systems behave theoretically when embedded in a cell of varying size or shape has not been considered.Results Here we use a simple mathematical model to explore the theoretical consequences of a plasma membrane bound activator (i.e., guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEF, or kinase) and a cytoplasmic deactivator (i.e., GAP or phosphatase), and we find that as a model cell grows, the substrate becomes progressively dephosphorylated as a result of decreased proximity to the activator. Conversely, as a cell spreads and flattens, the substrate becomes globally phosphorylated because of increased proximity of the substrate to the activator. Similarly, in the leading edge of polarized cells and in protrusions such as lamellipodia or filopodia, the substrate is highly phosphorylated. As a specific test of the model, we found that the experimentally observed preferential activation of the G protein Cdc42 in the periphery of fibroblasts that was recently reported is consistent with model predictions.Conclusions We conclude that cell-signaling pathways can theoretically be turned on and off, both locally and globally, in response to alterations in cell size and shape.},

	Abstract = {Summary The role of cell size and shape in controlling local intracellular signaling reactions, and how this spatial information originates and is propagated, is not well understood. We have used partial differential equations to model the flow of spatial information from the [beta]-adrenergic receptor to MAPK1,2 through the cAMP/PKA/B-Raf/MAPK1,2 network in neurons using real geometries. The numerical simulations indicated that cell shape controls the dynamics of local biochemical activity of signal-modulated negative regulators, such as phosphodiesterases and protein phosphatases within regulatory loops to determine the size of microdomains of activated signaling components. The model prediction that negative regulators control the flow of spatial information to downstream components was verified experimentally in rat hippocampal slices. These results suggest a mechanism by which cellular geometry, the presence of regulatory loops with negative regulators, and key reaction rates all together control spatial information transfer and microdomain characteristics within cells.},

@article{Pierres08,
	Abstract = {Cell membranes are studded with protrusions that were thoroughly analyzed with electron microscopy. However, the nanometer-scale three-dimensional motions generated by cell membranes to fit the topography of foreign surfaces and initiate adhesion remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the dynamics of surface deformations displayed by monocytic cells bumping against fibronectin-coated surfaces. We observed membrane undulations with typically 5 nm amplitude and 5-10 s lifetime. Cell membranes behaved as independent units of micrometer size. Cells detected the presence of foreign surfaces at 50 nm separation, resulting in time-dependent amplification of membrane undulations. Molecular contact then ensued with apparent cell-membrane separation of 30-40 nm, and this distance steadily decreased during the following tens of seconds. Contact maturation was associated with in-plane egress of bulky molecules and robust membrane fluctuations. Thus, membrane undulations may be the major determinant of cell sensitivity to substrate topography, outcome of interaction, and initial kinetics of contact extension.

	Abstract = {Cells are dynamical systems of biomolecular interactions that process information from their environment to mount diverse yet specific responses. A key property of many self-organized systems is that of criticality: a state of a system in which, on average, perturbations are neither dampened nor amplified, but are propagated over long temporal or spatial scales. Criticality enables the coordination of complex macroscopic behaviors that strike an optimal balance between stability and adaptability. It has long been hypothesized that biological systems are critical. Here, we address this hypothesis experimentally for system-wide gene expression dynamics in the macrophage. To this end, we have developed a method, based on algorithmic information theory, to assess macrophage criticality, and we have validated the method on networks with known properties. Using global gene expression data from macrophages stimulated with a variety of Toll-like receptor agonists, we found that macrophage dynamics are indeed critical, providing the most compelling evidence to date for this general principle of dynamics in biological systems.

	Abstract = {Integrin-mediated adhesion is regulated by multiple features of the adhesive surface, including its chemical composition, topography, and physical properties. In this study we investigated integrin lateral clustering, as a mechanism to control integrin functions, by characterizing the effect of nanoscale variations in the spacing between adhesive RGD ligands on cell spreading, migration, and focal adhesion dynamics. For this purpose, we used nanopatterned surfaces, containing RGD-biofunctionalized gold dots, surrounded by passivated gaps. By varying the spacing between the dots, we modulated the clustering of the associated integrins. We show that cell-surface attachment is not sensitive to pattern density, whereas the formation of stable focal adhesions and persistent spreading is. Thus cells plated on a 108-nm-spaced pattern exhibit delayed spreading with repeated protrusion-retraction cycles compared to cells growing on a 58-nm pattern. Cell motility on these surfaces is erratic and nonpersistent, leaving thin membrane tethers bound to the RGD pattern. Dynamic molecular profiling indicated that the adhesion sites formed with the 108-nm pattern undergo rapid turnover and contain reduced levels of zyxin. These findings indicate that a critical RGD density is essential for the establishment of mature and stable integrin adhesions, which, in turn, induce efficient cell spreading and formation of focal adhesions.

@article{Ory2007a,
	Abstract = {Background information. Rho GTPases are important regulators of cytoskeleton dynamics and cell adhesion. RhoU/Wrch-1 is a Rho GTPase which shares sequence similarities with Rac1 and Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42), but has also extended N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal extension promotes binding to SH3 (Src homology 3)-domain-containing adaptors, whereas the C-terminal extension mediates membrane targeting through palmitoylation of its non-conventional CAAX box. RhoU/Wrch-1 possesses transforming activity, which is negatively regulated by its N-terminal extension and depends on palmitoylation.Results. In the present study, we have shown that RhoU is localized to podosomes in osteoclasts and c-Src-expressing cells, and to focal adhesions of HeLa cells and fibroblasts. The N-terminal extension and the palmitoylation site were dispensable, whereas the C-terminal extension and effector binding loop were critical for RhoU targeting to focal adhesions. Moreover, the number of focal adhesions was reduced and their distribution changed upon expression of activated RhoU. Conversely, RhoU silencing increased the number of focal adhesions. As RhoU was only transiently associated with adhesion structures, this suggests that RhoU may modify adhesion turnover and cell migration rate. Indeed, we found that migration distances were increased in cells expressing activated RhoU and decreased when RhoU was knocked-down.Conclusions. Our data indicate that RhoU localizes to adhesion structures, regulates their number and distribution and increases cell motility. It also suggests that the RhoU effector binding and C-terminal domains are critical for these functions.

@article{Efimov2008a,
	Abstract = {An organized microtubule array is essential for the polarized motility of fibroblasts. Dynamic microtubules closely interact with focal adhesion sites in migrating cells. Here, we examined the effect of focal adhesions on microtubule dynamics. We observed that the probability of microtubule catastrophes (transitions from growth to shrinkage) was seven times higher at focal adhesions than elsewhere. Analysis of the dependence between the microtubule growth rate and catastrophe probability throughout the cytoplasm revealed that a nonspecific (mechanical or spatial) factor provided a minor contribution to the catastrophe induction by decreasing microtubule growth rate at adhesions. Strikingly, at the same growth rate, the probability of catastrophes was significantly higher at adhesions than elsewhere, indicative of a site-specific biochemical trigger. The observed catastrophe induction occurred at adhesion domains containing the scaffolding protein paxillin that has been shown previously to interact with tubulin. Furthermore, replacement of full-length paxillin at adhesion sites by microinjected paxillin LIM2-LIM3 domains suppressed microtubule catastrophes exclusively at adhesions. We suggest that paxillin influences microtubule dynamics at focal adhesions by serving as a scaffold for a putative catastrophe factor and/or regulating its exposure to microtubules. },

Recent advances in sample preparation, microscope design and image processing allow the generation of `multidimensional' data, simultaneously reporting the three-dimensional distribution and concentrations of several different molecules within cells and tissues at multiple time points with sub-micron spatial resolution and sub-second temporal resolution. Thus, molecular interactions and processes that were approached by biochemical analyses in vitro can now be directly monitored in live cells.

	Abstract = { In focal adhesions of eukaryotic cells, transmembrane receptors of the integrin family and a large set of adaptor proteins form the physical link between the extracellular substrate and the actin cytoskeleton. During cell migration, nascent focal adhesions within filopodia and lamellipodia make the initial exploratory contacts with the cellular environment, whereas maturing focal adhesions pull the cell forward against the resistance of `sliding' focal adhesions at the cell rear. Experimental approaches are now available for analysing the dynamics and interior structure of these different focal adhesions. Analysing focal-adhesion dynamics using green-fluorescent-protein-linked integrin leads us to propose that the acto-myosin-controlled density and turnover of integrins in focal adhesions is used to sense the elasticity and spacing of extracellular ligands, regulating cell migration by mechanically transduced signaling.},

	Abstract = { Integrin-linked focal adhesion complexes provide the main sites of cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and associate with the actin cytoskeleton to control cell movement. Dynamic regulation of focal adhesions and reorganization of the associated actin cytoskeleton are crucial determinants of cell migration. There are important roles for tyrosine kinases, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling, and intracellular and extracellular proteases during actin and adhesion modulation. Dysregulation of these is associated with tumour cell invasion. In this article, we discuss established roles for these signalling pathways, as well as the functional interplay between them in controlling the migratory phenotype.},

@article{Owen2007a,
	Abstract = {Macrophages are a key component of the innate immune system. In this study, we investigate how focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the related kinase Pyk2 integrate adhesion signaling and growth factor receptor signaling to regulate diverse macrophage functions. Primary bone marrow macrophages isolated from mice in which FAK is conditionally deleted from cells of the myeloid lineage exhibited elevated protrusive activity, altered adhesion dynamics, impaired chemotaxis, elevated basal Rac1 activity, and a marked inability to form stable lamellipodia necessary for directional locomotion. The contribution of FAK to macrophage function in vitro was substantiated in vivo by the finding that recruitment of monocytes to sites of inflammation was impaired in the absence of FAK. Decreased Pyk2 expression in primary macrophages also resulted in a diminution of invasive capacity. However, the combined loss of FAK and Pyk2 had no greater effect than the loss of either molecule alone, indicating that both kinases function within the same pathway to promote invasion.

@article{BenediktSabass01012008,
	Abstract = {Cell adhesion and migration crucially depend on the transmission of actomyosin-generated forces through sites of focal adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Here we report experimental and computational advances in improving the resolution and reliability of traction force microscopy. First, we introduce the use of two differently colored nanobeads as fiducial markers in polyacrylamide gels and explain how the displacement field can be computationally extracted from the fluorescence data. Second, we present different improvements regarding standard methods for force reconstruction from the displacement field, which are the boundary element method, Fourier-transform traction cytometry, and traction reconstruction with point forces. Using extensive data simulation, we show that the spatial resolution of the boundary element method can be improved considerably by splitting the elastic field into near, intermediate, and far field. Fourier-transform traction cytometry requires considerably less computer time, but can achieve a comparable resolution only when combined with Wiener filtering or appropriate regularization schemes. Both methods tend to underestimate forces, especially at small adhesion sites. Traction reconstruction with point forces does not suffer from this limitation, but is only applicable with stationary and well-developed adhesion sites. Third, we combine these advances and for the first time reconstruct fibroblast traction with a spatial resolution of [~]1 {micro}m.

	Abstract = {Focal adhesions (FAs) regulate cell migration. Vinculin, with its many potential binding partners, can interconnect signals in FAs. Despite the well-characterized structure of vinculin, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action have remained unclear. Here, using vinculin mutants, we separate the vinculin head and tail regions into distinct functional domains. We show that the vinculin head regulates integrin dynamics and clustering and the tail regulates the link to the mechanotransduction force machinery. The expression of vinculin constructs with unmasked binding sites in the head and tail regions induces dramatic FA growth, which is mediated by their direct interaction with talin. This interaction leads to clustering of activated integrin and an increase in integrin residency time in FAs. Surprisingly, paxillin recruitment, induced by active vinculin constructs, occurs independently of its potential binding site in the vinculin tail. The vinculin tail, however, is responsible for the functional link of FAs to the actin cytoskeleton. We propose a new model that explains how vinculin orchestrates FAs.

@article{PanagiotisFlevaris11052007,
	Abstract = {Integrin-dependent cell spreading and retraction are required for cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, and thus are important in thrombosis, wound repair, immunity, and cancer development. It remains unknown how integrin outside-in signaling induces and controls these two opposite processes. This study reveals that calpain cleavage of integrin {beta}3 at Tyr759 switches the functional outcome of integrin signaling from cell spreading to retraction. Expression of a calpain cleavageresistant {beta}3 mutant in Chinese hamster ovary cells causes defective clot retraction and RhoA-mediated retraction signaling but enhances cell spreading. Conversely, a calpain-cleaved form of {beta}3 fails to mediate cell spreading, but inhibition of the RhoA signaling pathway corrects this defect. Importantly, the calpain-cleaved {beta}3 fails to bind c-Src, which is required for integrin-induced cell spreading, and this requirement of {beta}3-associated c-Src results from its inhibition of RhoA-dependent contractile signals. Thus, calpain cleavage of {beta}3 at Tyr759 relieves c-Srcmediated RhoA inhibition, activating the RhoA pathway that confines cell spreading and causes cell retraction.

	Abstract = {Technological advances in automated microscopy now allow rapid acquisition of many images without human intervention, images that can be used for large-scale screens. The main challenge in such screens is the conversion of the raw images into interpretable information and hence discoveries. This post-acquisition component of image-based screens requires computational steps to identify cells, choose the cells of interest, assess their phenotype, and identify statistically significant `hits'. Designing such an analysis pipeline requires careful consideration of the necessary hardware and software components, image analysis, statistical analysis and data presentation tools. Given the increasing availability of such hardware and software, these types of experiments have come within the reach of individual labs, heralding many interesting new ways of acquiring biological knowledge.

	Abstract = {We have analyzed the spontaneous symmetry breaking and initiation of actin-based motility in keratocytes (fish epithelial cells). In stationary keratocytes, the actin network flow was inwards and radially symmetric. Immediately before motility initiation, the actin network flow increased at the prospective cell rear and reoriented in the perinuclear region, aligning with the prospective axis of movement. Changes in actin network flow at the cell front were detectable only after cell polarization. Inhibition of myosin II or Rho kinase disrupted actin network organization and flow in the perinuclear region and decreased the motility initiation frequency, whereas increasing myosin II activity with calyculin A increased the motility initiation frequency. Local stimulation of myosin activity in stationary cells by the local application of calyculin A induced directed motility initiation away from the site of stimulation. Together, these results indicate that large-scale actinmyosin network reorganization and contractility at the cell rear initiate spontaneous symmetry breaking and polarized motility of keratocytes. },

	Abstract = {To investigate the unregulated Ras activation associated with cancer, we developed and validated a mathematical model of Ras signaling. The model-based predictions and associated experiments help explain why only one of two classes of activating Ras point mutations with in vitro transformation potential is commonly found in cancers. Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted behavior was supported by experimental observations. We also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the wild-type network. This system-level analysis of the oncogenic Ras network provides new insights and potential therapeutic strategies. },

	Abstract = {Detachment of parenchymal cells from a solid matrix switches contextual cues from survival to death during anoikis. Marked shape changes accompany detachment and are thought to trigger cell death, although a working model to explain the coordination of attachment sensation, shape change, and cell fate is elusive. The constitutive form of the adapter Shc, p52Shc, confers survival properties, whereas the longer p66Shc signals death through association with cytochrome c. We find that cells that lack p66Shc display poorly formed focal adhesions and escape anoikis. However, reexpression of p66Shc restores anoikis through a mechanism requiring focal adhesion targeting and RhoA activation but not an intact cytochrome cbinding motif. This pathway stimulates the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers in attached cells and tension-dependent cell death upon detachment. p66Shc may thus report attachment status to the cell by imposing a tension test across candidate anchorage points, with load failure indicating detachment.

@article{Gupton2007,
	Abstract = {Cell migration requires spatial and temporal regulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamics. This regulation is achieved by distinct actin-associated proteins, which mediate polymerization, depolymerization, severing, contraction, bundling or engagement to the membrane. Mammalian Diaphanous-related (mDia) formins, which nucleate, processively elongate, and in some cases bundle actin filaments, have been extensively studied in vitro, but their function in the cell has been less well characterized. Here we study the role of mDia2 activity in the dynamic organization of F-actin in migrating epithelial cells. We find that mDia2 localizes in the lamella of migrating epithelial cells, where it is involved in the formation of a stable pool of cortical actin and in maintenance of polymerization-competent free filament barbed ends at focal adhesions. Specific inhibition of mDia2 alters focal adhesion turnover and reduces migration velocity. We suggest that the regulation of filament assembly dynamics at focal adhesions may be necessary for the formation of a stable pool of cortical lamella actin and the proper assembly and disassembly dynamics of focal adhesions, making mDia2 an important factor in epithelial cell migration. },

@article{Giannone2007a,
	Abstract = {Summary Cell motility proceeds by cycles of edge protrusion, adhesion, and retraction. Whether these functions are coordinated by biochemical or biomechanical processes is unknown. We find that myosin II pulls the rear of the lamellipodial actin network, causing upward bending, edge retraction, and initiation of new adhesion sites. The network then separates from the edge and condenses over the myosin. Protrusion resumes as lamellipodial actin regenerates from the front and extends rearward until it reaches newly assembled myosin, initiating the next cycle. Upward bending, observed by evanescence and electron microscopy, results in ruffle formation when adhesion strength is low. Correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy shows that the regenerating lamellipodium forms a cohesive, separable layer of actin above the lamellum. Thus, actin polymerization periodically builds a mechanical link, the lamellipodium, connecting myosin motors with the initiation of adhesion sites, suggesting that the major functions driving motility are coordinated by a biomechanical process.},

	Abstract = {Microscopy of cells has changed dramatically since its early days in the mid-seventeenth century. Image analysis has concurrently evolved from measurements of hand drawings and still photographs to computational methods that (semi-) automatically quantify objects, distances, concentrations, and velocities of cells and subcellular structures. Today's imaging technologies generate a wealth of data that requires visualization and multi-dimensional and quantitative image analysis as prerequisites to turning qualitative data into quantitative values. Such quantitative data provide the basis for mathematical modeling of protein kinetics and biochemical signaling networks that, in turn, open the way toward a quantitative view of cell biology. Here, we will review technologies for analyzing and reconstructing dynamic structures and processes in the living cell. We will present live-cell studies that would have been impossible without computational imaging. These applications illustrate the potential of computational imaging to enhance our knowledge of the dynamics of cellular structures and processes.

	Abstract = {Motivation: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the first eukaryotic organism to have its genome completely sequenced. Since then, several large-scale analyses of the yeast genome have provided extensive functional annotations of individual genes and proteins. One fundamental property of a protein is its subcellular localization, which provides critical information about how this protein works in a cell. An important project therefore was the creation of the yeast GFP fusion localization database by the University of California, San Francisco, USA (UCSF). This database provides localization data for 75% of the proteins believed to be encoded by the yeast genome. These proteins were classified into 22 distinct subcellular location categories by visual examination. Based on our past success at building automated systems to classify subcellular location patterns in mammalian cells, we sought to create a similar system for yeast.  Results: We developed computational methods to automatically analyze the images created by the UCSF yeast GFP fusion localization project. The system was trained to recognize the same location categories that were used in that study. We applied the system to 2640 images, and the system gave the same label as the previous assignments to 2139 images (81%). When only the highest confidence assignments were considered, 94.7% agreement was observed. Visual examination of the proteins for which the two approaches disagree suggests that at least some of the automated assignments may be more accurate. The automated method provides an objective, quantitative and repeatable assignment of protein locations that can be applied to new collections of yeast images (e.g. for different strains or the same strain under different conditions). It is also important to note that this performance could be achieved without requiring colocalization with any marker proteins.  Availability: The original images analyzed in this article are available at http://yeastgfp.ucsf.edu, and source code and results are available at http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software  Contact: murphy@cmu.edu

	Abstract = {Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are critical regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and control complex functions such as cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and cell division. It is generally accepted that localized GTPase activation is required for the proper initiation of downstream signaling events, although the molecular mechanisms that control targeting of Rho GTPases are unknown. In this study, we show that the Rho GTPase Rac1, via a proline stretch in its COOH terminus, binds directly to the SH3 domain of the Cdc42/Rac activator {beta}-Pix (p21-activated kinase [Pak]-interacting exchange factor). The interaction with {beta}-Pix is nucleotide independent and is necessary and sufficient for Rac1 recruitment to membrane ruffles and to focal adhesions. In addition, the Rac1-{beta}-Pix interaction is required for Rac1 activation by {beta}-Pix as well as for Rac1-mediated spreading. Finally, using cells deficient for the {beta}-Pix-binding kinase Pak1, we show that Pak1 regulates the Rac1-{beta}-Pix interaction and controls cell spreading and adhesion-induced Rac1 activation. These data provide a model for the intracellular targeting and localized activation of Rac1 through its exchange factor {beta}-Pix.},

This is illustrated by the use of the techniques of object-oriented modelling, where the computer is used to construct abstractions of objects in the domain being modelled, and these objects then interact within the computer to simulate the system and allow emergent properties to be observed. The paper also discusses the role of computer simulation in understanding complexity in biological systems, and the kinds of information which can be obtained about biology via simulation.},

	Abstract = {Agent-based complex systems are dynamic networks of many interacting agents; examples include ecosystems, financial markets, and cities. The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

	Abstract = {Cell polarity is a general cellular process that can be seen in various cell types such as migrating neutrophils and Dictyostelium cells. The Rho small GTP(guanosine 5&#8242;-tri phosphate)ases have been shown to regulate cell polarity; however, its mechanism of emergence has yet to be clarified. We first developed a reaction&#8211;diffusion model of the Rho GTPases, which exhibits switch-like reversible response to a gradient of extracellular signals, exclusive accumulation of Cdc42 and Rac, or RhoA at the maximal or minimal intensity of the signal, respectively, and tracking of changes of a signal gradient by the polarized peak. The previous cell polarity models proposed by Subramanian and Narang show similar behaviors to our Rho GTPase model, despite the difference in molecular networks. This led us to compare these models, and we found that these models commonly share instability and a mass conservation of components. Based on these common properties, we developed conceptual models of a mass conserved reaction&#8211;diffusion system with diffusion&#8211;driven instability. These conceptual models retained similar behaviors of cell polarity in the Rho GTPase model. Using these models, we numerically and analytically found that multiple polarized peaks are unstable, resulting in a single stable peak (uniqueness of axis), and that sensitivity toward changes of a signal gradient is specifically restricted at the polarized peak (localized sensitivity). Although molecular networks may differ from one cell type to another, the behaviors of cell polarity in migrating cells seem similar, suggesting that there should be a fundamental principle. Thus, we propose that a mass conserved reaction&#8211;diffusion system with diffusion-driven instability is one of such principles of cell polarity.},

	Abstract = {We examined the dynamics of radial actin bundles based on time-lapse movies of polarized light images of living neuronal growth cones. Using a highly sensitive computer vision algorithm for tracking, we analyzed the small shape fluctuations of radial actin bundles that otherwise remained stationary in their positions in the growth cone lamellipodium. Using the tracking software, we selected target points on radial bundles and measured both the local bundle orientations and the lateral displacements between consecutive movie frames. We found that the local orientation and the lateral displacement of a target point are correlated. The correlation can be explained using a simple geometric relationship between the lateral travel of tilted actin bundles and the retrograde flow of f-actin structures. Once this relationship has been established, we have turned the table and used the radial bundles as probes to measure the velocity field of f-actin flow. We have generated a detailed map of the complex retrograde flow pattern throughout the lamellipodium. Such two-dimensional flow maps will give new insights into the mechanisms responsible for f-actin-mediated cell motility and growth.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the motion of filopodia and actin bundles in lamellipodia of motile cells, using time-lapse sequences of polarized light images. We measured the velocity of retrograde flow of the actin network and the lateral motion of filopodia and actin bundles of the lamellipodium. Upon noting that laterally moving filopodia and actin bundles are always tilted with respect to the direction of retrograde flow, we propose a simple geometric model for the mechanism of lateral motion. The model establishes a relationship between the speed of lateral motion of actin bundles, their tilt angle with respect to the direction of retrograde flow, and the speed of retrograde flow in the lamellipodium. Our experimental results verify the quantitative predictions of the model. Furthermore, our observations support the hypothesis that lateral movement of filopodia is caused by retrograde flow of tilted actin bundles and by their growth through actin polymerization at the tip of the bundles inside the filopodia. Therefore we conclude that the lateral motion of tilted filopodia and actin bundles does not require a separate motile mechanism but is the result of retrograde flow and the assembly of actin filaments and bundles near the leading edge of the lamellipodium.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a new imaging technique with the potential for simultaneous visualization of translocation and dynamic turnover of polymer structures. However, the use of FSM has been limited by the lack of specialized software for analysis of the positional and photometric fluctuations of hundreds of thousand speckles in an FSM time-lapse series, and for translating this data into biologically relevant information. In this paper we present a first version of a software for automated analysis of FSM movies. We focus on mapping the assembly and disassembly kinetics of a polymer meshwork. As a model system we have employed cortical F-actin meshworks in live newt lung epithelial cells. We lay out the algorithm in detail and present results of our analysis. The high spatial and temporal resolution of our maps reveals a kinetic cycling of F-actin, where phases of polymerization alternate with depolymerization in a spatially coordinated fashion. The cycle rates change when treating cells with a low dose of the drug latrunculin A. This shows the potential of this technique for future quantitative screening of drugs affecting the actin cytoskeleton. Various control experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is robust with respect to intensity variations due to noise and photobleaching and that effects of focus plane drifts can be eliminated by manual refocusing during image acquisition.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is becoming the technique of choice for analyzing in vivo the dynamics of polymer assemblies, such as the cytoskeleton. The massive amount of data produced by this method calls for computational approaches to recover the quantities of interest; namely, the polymerization and depolymerization activities and the motions undergone by the cytoskeleton over time. Attempts toward this goal have been hampered by the limited signal-to-noise ratio of typical FSM data, by the constant appearance and disappearance of speckles due to polymer turnover, and by the presence of flow singularities characteristic of many cytoskeletal polymer assemblies. To deal with these problems, we present a particle-based method for tracking fluorescent speckles in time-lapse FSM image series, based on ideas from operational research and graph theory. Our software delivers the displacements of thousands of speckles between consecutive frames, taking into account that speckles may appear and disappear. In this article we exploit this information to recover the speckle flow field. First, the software is tested on synthetic data to validate our methods. We then apply it to mapping filamentous actin retrograde flow at the front edge of migrating newt lung epithelial cells. Our results confirm findings from previously published kymograph analyses and manual tracking of such FSM data and illustrate the power of automated tracking for generating complete and quantitative flow measurements. Third, we analyze microtubule poleward flux in mitotic metaphase spindles assembled in Xenopus egg extracts, bringing new insight into the dynamics of microtubule assemblies in this system.},

	Abstract = {Cell migration initiates by extension of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge. Computational analysis of fluorescent speckle microscopy movies of migrating epithelial cells revealed this process is mediated by two spatially colocalized but kinematically, kinetically, molecularly, and functionally distinct actin networks. A lamellipodium network assembled at the leading edge but completely disassembled within 1 to 3 micrometers. It was weakly coupled to the rest of the cytoskeleton and promoted the random protrusion and retraction of the leading edge. Productive cell advance was a function of the second colocalized network, the lamella, where actomyosin contraction was integrated with substrate adhesion.},

	Abstract = {We report advances in quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy to generate simultaneous maps of cytoskeleton flow and rates of net assembly and disassembly in living cells. We apply this tool to analyze the filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamics at the front of migrating cells. F-actin turnover and flow are both known to be factors of cell locomotion. However, how they are orchestrated to produce directed cell movements is poorly understood. Our approach to data analysis allows us to examine their interdependence. Our maps confirm the previously described organization of flow into a lamellipodium and a lamellum, both exhibiting retrograde flow; and a convergence zone, where lamellum retrograde flow meets with slow anterograde flow of cortical F-actin at the ventral side of the cell body. The turnover maps show the well known actin polymerization at the leading edge, but also indicate that {approx}90% of the polymer disassembles at the lamellipodium-lamellum junction. Strong depolymerization is also found in the convergence zone, where meshwork contraction is prominent. To determine whether contraction and depolymerization are coupled events, we have treated cells with calyculin A, which is known to promote myosin activity. Stimulated contraction was accompanied by accelerated retrograde flow and increased depolymerization throughout the lamellum, whereas disassembly at the lamellipodium-lamellum junction remained unaffected. There appear to be two distinct depolymerization mechanisms, of which one depends directly on meshwork contraction.},

	Abstract = {To elucidate the regulation of kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) by kinetochore proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we need tools to characterize and compare stochastic kMT dynamics. Here we show that autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, combined with a statistical framework for testing the significance of differences between ARMA model parameters, provide a sensitive method for identifying the subtle changes in kMT dynamics associated with kinetochore protein mutations. Applying ARMA analysis to G1 kMT dynamics, we found that 1), kMT dynamics in the kinetochore protein mutants okp1-5 and kip3{Delta} are different from those in wild-type, demonstrating the regulation of kMTs by kinetochore proteins; 2), the kinase Ipl1p regulates kMT dynamics also in G1; and 3), the mutant dam1-1 exhibits three different phenotypes, indicating the central role of Dam1p in maintaining the attachment of kMTs and regulating their dynamics. We also confirmed that kMT dynamics vary with temperature, and are most likely differentially regulated at 37{degrees}C. Therefore, when elucidating the role of a protein in kMT regulation using a temperature-sensitive mutant, dynamics in the mutant at its nonpermissive temperature must be compared to those in wild-type at the same temperature, not to those in the mutant at its permissive temperature.},

	Abstract = {Many features of cell behavior are regulated by Rho family GTPases, but the most profound effects of these proteins are on the actin cytoskeleton and it was these that first drew attention to this family of signaling proteins. Focusing on Rho and Rac, we will discuss how their effectors regulate the actin cytoskeleton. We will describe how the activity of Rho proteins is regulated downstream from growth factor receptors and cell adhesion molecules by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins. Additionally, we will discuss how there is signaling crosstalk between family members and how various bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to manipulate Rho protein activity so as to enhance their own survival.},

	Abstract = {Cell migration involves dynamic and spatially regulated changes to the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion. The Rho GTPases play key roles in coordinating the cellular responses required for cell migration. Recent research has revealed new molecular links between Rho family proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, showing that they act to regulate actin polymerization, depolymerization and the activity of actin-associated myosins. In addition, studies on integrin signalling suggest that the substratum continuously feeds signals to Rho proteins in migrating cells to influence migration rate. There is also increasing evidence that Rho proteins affect the organization of the microtubule and intermediate filament networks and that this is important for cell migration.},

@article{Kasahara2006,
	Abstract = {Src family non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases regulate a wide variety of cellular events including cell cycle progression in G2/M phase. Here, we show that Src signaling regulates the terminal step in cytokinesis called abscission in HeLa cells. Abscission failure with an unusually elongated intercellular bridge containing the midbody is induced by treatment with the chemical Src inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 or expression of membrane-anchored Csk chimeras. By anti-phosphotyrosine immunofluorescence and live cell imaging, completion of abscission requires Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation during early stages of mitosis (before cleavage furrow formation), which is subsequently delivered to the midbody through Rab11-driven vesicle transport. Treatment with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, decreases tyrosine phosphorylation levels at the midbody, leading to abscission failure. Activated ERK by MEK-catalyzed dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues in the TEY sequence, which is strongly detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, is transported to the midbody in a Rab11-dependent manner. Src kinase activity during the early mitosis mediates ERK activation in late cytokinesis, indicating that Src-mediated signaling for abscission is spatially and temporally transmitted. Thus, these results suggest that recruitment of activated ERK, which is phosphorylated by MEK downstream of Src kinases, to the midbody plays an important role in completion of abscission.},

@article{Anton2003,
	Abstract = {Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a chemotactic factor for fibroblasts that triggers actin cytoskeleton reorganization by increasing the level of GTP-Rac, the activated form of a small Rho family GTPase. GTP-Rac induces membrane ruffling and lamellipodium formation that are required for adhesion, migration and macropinocytosis, among other functions. We have shown that WIP interacts with members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family and is essential for filopodium formation regulated by Cdc42 GTPase. In this report, we show that WIP participates in the actin reorganization that leads to ruffle formation. WIP overexpression in murine fibroblasts (3T3 cells) enhances ruffle formation in response to PDGF stimulation, as shown by immunofluorescence and electron and video microscopy. More importantly, microinjection of anti-WIP antibody or absence of WIP in murine fibroblasts results in decreased ruffle formation in response to PDGF treatment. Finally, overexpression of a modified form of WIP lacking the actin-binding site blocks PDGF-induced membrane ruffling. These data suggest a role for WIP in actin reorganization to form PDGF-induced ruffles. This is the first in vivo evidence in mammalian cells for a function of WIP dependent on its ability to bind actin.},

@article{Zamir01,
	Abstract = {Currently >50 proteins have been reported to be associated with focal contacts and related ECM adhesions. Most of these contain multiple domains through which they can interact with different molecular partners, potentially forming a dense and heterogeneous protein network at the cytoplasmic faces of the adhesion site. The molecular and structural diversity of this  submembrane plaque' is regulated by a wide variety of mechanisms, including competition between different partner proteins for the same binding sites, interactions triggered or suppressed by tyrosine phosphorylation, and conformational changes in component proteins, which can affect their reactivity. Indeed, integrin-mediated adhesions can undergo dynamic changes in structure and molecular properties from dot-like focal complexes to stress-fiber-associated focal contacts, which can further  mature' to form fibronectin-bound fibrillar adhesions. These changes are driven by mechanical force generated by the actin- and myosin-containing contractile machinery of the cells, or by external forces applied to the cells, and regulated by matrix rigidity.

	Abstract = {The Diaphanous-related formin Dia1 nucleates actin polymerization, thereby regulating cell shape and motility. Mechanisms that control the cellular location of Dia1 to spatially define actin polymerization are largely unknown. In this study, we identify the cytoskeletal scaffold protein IQGAP1 as a Dia1-binding protein that is necessary for its subcellular location. IQGAP1 interacts with Dia1 through a region within the Diaphanous inhibitory domain after the RhoA-mediated release of Dia1 autoinhibition. Both proteins colocalize at the front of migrating cells but also at the actin-rich phagocytic cup in macrophages. We show that IQGAP1 interaction with Dia1 is required for phagocytosis and phagocytic cup formation. Thus, we identify IQGAP1 as a novel component involved in the regulation of phagocytosis by mediating the localization of the actin filament nucleator Dia1.

@article{Machacek06,
	Abstract = {We propose a framework for tracking arbitrary complex cell boundary movements, relying on a unique definition of protrusion and retraction as the pathlength a virtual edge marker traverses when moving continuously perpendicular to the cell boundary. We introduce the level set method as a numerical scheme to reconstruct continuous boundary movement in time-lapse image sequences with finite time sampling. For moderately complex movements, we describe a numerically less expensive method that satisfactorily approximates the definition. Densely sampled protrusion and retraction rates were accumulated in space-time charts revealing distinct morphodynamic states. Applying this technique to the profiling of epithelial cell protrusion we identified three different states. In the I-state, long cell edge sectors are synchronized in cycles of protrusion and retraction. In the V-state random bursts of protrusion initiate protrusion waves propagating transversally in both directions. Cells switch between both states dependent on the Rac1 activation level. Furthermore, the persistence of transversal waves in the V-state depends on Arp2/3 concentration. Inhibition of PAK shifts cells into a{lambda} -state where continuous protrusion is occasionally interrupted by self-propagating ruffles. Our data support a model where activation of Rac1 mediates the propagation of protrusion waves, whose persistence depends on the relative abundance of activated Arp2/3 and polymerizable G-actin.

	Abstract = {Signal transduction pathways control cellular responses to stimuli, but it is unclear how molecular information is processed as a network. We constructed a systems model of 7980 intracellular signaling events that directly links measurements to 1440 response outputs associated with apoptosis. The model accurately predicted multiple time-dependent apoptotic responses induced by a combination of the death-inducing cytokine tumor necrosis factor with the prosurvival factors epidermal growth factor and insulin. By capturing the role of unsuspected autocrine circuits activated by transforming growth factor-{alpha} and interleukin-1{alpha}, the model revealed new molecular mechanisms connecting signaling to apoptosis. The model derived two groupings of intracellular signals that constitute fundamental dimensions (molecular "basis axes") within the apoptotic signaling network. Projection along these axes captures the entire measured apoptotic network, suggesting that cell survival is determined by signaling through this canonical basis set.

@article{Sachs05,
	Abstract = {Machine learning was applied for the automated derivation of causal influences in cellular signaling networks. This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods automatically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified experimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signaling biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells.

@article{Hu07,
	Abstract = {Cell migration requires the transmission of motion generated in the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular environment through a complex assembly of proteins in focal adhesions. We developed correlational fluorescent speckle microscopy to measure the coupling of focal-adhesion proteins to actin filaments. Different classes of focal-adhesion structural and regulatory molecules exhibited varying degrees of correlated motions with actin filaments, indicating hierarchical transmission of actin motion through focal adhesions. Interactions between vinculin, talin, and actin filaments appear to constitute a slippage interface between the cytoskeleton and integrins, generating a molecular clutch that is regulated during the morphodynamic transitions of cell migration.

@article{Kim06,
	Abstract = {Most studies of protein networks operate on a high level of abstraction, neglecting structural and chemical aspects of each interaction. Here, we characterize interactions by using atomic-resolution information from three-dimensional protein structures. We find that some previously recognized relationships between network topology and genomic features (e.g., hubs tending to be essential proteins) are actually more reflective of a structural quantity, the number of distinct binding interfaces. Subdividing hubs with respect to this quantity provides insight into their evolutionary rate and indicates that additional mechanisms of network growth are active in evolution (beyond effective preferential attachment through gene duplication).

	Abstract = {We present an independent evaluation of six recent hidden Markov model (HMM) genefinders. Each was tested on the new dataset (FSH298), the results of which showed no dramatic improvement over the genefinders tested five years ago. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of predicted exons and classify each resulting exon accordingly. These results are useful in measuring (with finer granularity) the effects of changes in a genefinder. We present an analysis of these results and identify four patterns of inaccuracy common in all HMM-based results.

@article{Dojer06,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:A central goal of molecular biology is to understand the regulatory mechanisms of gene transcription and protein synthesis. Because of their solid basis in statistics, allowing to deal with the stochastic aspects of gene expressions and noisy measurements in a natural way, Bayesian networks appear attractive in the field of inferring gene interactions structure from microarray experiments data. However, the basic formalism has some disadvantages, e.g. it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the origin and the target of an interaction. Two kinds of microarray experiments yield data particularly rich in information regarding the direction of interactions: time series and perturbation experiments. In order to correctly handle them, the basic formalism must be modified. For example, dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) apply to time series microarray data. To our knowledge the DBN technique has not been applied in the context of perturbation experiments.RESULTS:We extend the framework of dynamic Bayesian networks in order to incorporate perturbations. Moreover, an exact algorithm for inferring an optimal network is proposed and a discretization method specialized for time series data from perturbation experiments is introduced. We apply our procedure to realistic simulations data. The results are compared with those obtained by standard DBN learning techniques. Moreover, the advantages of using exact learning algorithm instead of heuristic methods are analyzed.CONCLUSION:We show that the quality of inferred networks dramatically improves when using data from perturbation experiments. We also conclude that the exact algorithm should be used when it is possible, i.e. when considered set of genes is small enough.},

	Abstract = {Global transcription machinery engineering (gTME) is an approach for reprogramming gene transcription to elicit cellular phenotypes important for technological applications. Here we show the application of gTME to Saccharomyces cerevisiae for improved glucose/ethanol tolerance, a key trait for many biofuels programs. Mutagenesis of the transcription factor Spt15p and selection led to dominant mutations that conferred increased tolerance and more efficient glucose conversion to ethanol. The desired phenotype results from the combined effect of three separate mutations in the SPT15 gene [serine substituted for phenylalanine (Phe177Ser) and, similarly, Tyr195His, and Lys218Arg]. Thus, gTME can provide a route to complex phenotypes that are not readily accessible by traditional methods.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: In recent years, single-cell biology has focused on the relationship between the stochastic nature of molecular interactions and variability of cellular behavior. To describe this relationship, it is necessary to develop new computational approaches at the single-cell level. Results: We have developed AgentCell, a model using agent-based technology to study the relationship between stochastic intracellular processes and behavior of individual cells. As a test-bed for our approach we use bacterial chemotaxis, one of the best characterized biological systems. In this model, each bacterium is an agent equipped with its own chemotaxis network, motors and flagella. Swimming cells are free to move in a 3D environment. Digital chemotaxis assays reproduce experimental data obtained from both single cells and bacterial populations. Availability: AgentCell is available on request from the authors.
