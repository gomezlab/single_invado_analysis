function threshold = adaptive_thresh(I,varargin)
% ADPATIVE_THRESH    finds a threshold which separates a given image into
%                    background and signal, assuming a bimodal histrogram
%                    is present, uses the algoritm from p.599-600 in
%                    Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods
%
%   adaptive_thresh(I) using the pixel values in image 'I', find and return
%   a threshold which should separate the image into background and signal 
%
%   adaptive_thresh(I,'up_mean_weight',W) using the pixel values in image
%   'I', find and return a threshold which should separate the image into
%   background and signal using a fractional weight 'W' on the upper mean
