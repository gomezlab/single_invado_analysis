% NORMALIZE_GRAYSCALE_IMAGE    using a given image, the same image with the

%                              0 and 1 respectively is returned in double

%   normalize_grayscale_image(I) normalize the image 'I' to have min and

%
%   normalize_grayscale_image(I,'min_max',M) normalize the image 'I'
%   assuming that the two values in the array 'M' are the min and max
%   value, with the first value 'M(1)' is the min and the second 'M(2)' is
%   the max
