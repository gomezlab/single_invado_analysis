=head1 NAME

Text::CSV::Simple - Simpler parsing of CSV files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $parser = Text::CSV::Simple->new;
	my @data = $parser->read_file($datafile);
	print @$_ foreach @data;

	# Only want certain fields?
	my $parser = Text::CSV::Simple->new;
	$parser->want_fields(1, 2, 4, 8);
	my @data = $parser->read_file($datafile);

	# Map the fields to a hash?
	my $parser = Text::CSV::Simple->new;
	$parser->field_map(qw/id name null town/);
	my @data = $parser->read_file($datafile);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parsing CSV files is nasty. It seems so simple, but it usually isn't.
Thankfully Text::CSV takes care of most of that nastiness for us.

Like many modules which have to deal with all manner of nastiness and
edge cases, however, it can be clumsy to work with in the simple case.

Thus this module.

We simply provide a little wrapper around Text::CSV to streamline the
common case scenario. (Or at least B<my> common case scenario; feel free
to write your own wrapper if this one doesn't do what you want).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

	my $parser = Text::CSV::Simple->new(\%options);

Construct a new parser. This takes all the same options as Text::CSV.

=head2 read_file

	my @data = $parser->read_file($filename);

Read the data in the given file, parse it, and return it as a list of
data.

Each entry in the returned list will be a listref of parsed CSV data.

=head2 want_fields

	$parser->want_fields(1, 2, 4, 8);

If you only want to extract certain fields from the CSV, you can set up
the list of fields you want, and, hey presto, those are the only ones
that will be returned in each listref. The fields, as with Perl arrays,
are zero based (i.e. the above example returns the second, third, fifth
and ninth entries for each line)

=head2 field_map

	$parser->field_map(qw/id name null town null postcode/);

Rather than getting back a listref for each entry in your CSV file, you
often want a hash of data with meaningful names. If you set up a field_map
giving the name you'd like for each field, then we do the right thing
for you! Fields named 'null' vanish into the ether.

=head1 TRIGGER POINTS

To enable you to make this module do things that I haven't dreamed off
(without you having to bother me with requests to extend the
functionality), we use Class::Trigger to provide a variety of points at
which you can hook in and do what you need. In general these should be
attached to the $parser object you've already created, although you
could also subclass this module and set these up as class data.

Each time we call a trigger we wrap it in an eval block. If the eval
block catches an error we simply call 'next' on the loop. These can
therefore be used for short-circuiting.on certain conditions.

=head2 before_parse

  $parser->add_trigger(before_parse => sub {
    my ($self, $line) = @_;
    die unless $line =~ /wanted/i;
  });

Before we call Text::CSV 'parse' on each line of input text, we call
the before_parse trigger with that line of text.

=head2 after_parse

  $parser->add_trigger(after_parse => sub {
    my ($self, $data) = @_;
    die unless $wanted{$data->[0]};
  });

After we sucessfully call Text::CSV 'parse' on each line of input text,
we call the after_parse trigger with a list ref of the values 

=head2 error

Currenly, for each line that we can't parse, we call the 'failure'
trigger (with the Text::CSV parser object), which emits a warning
and moves on. This happens in an invisible superclass, so you can supply
your own behaviour here:

	$parser->add_trigger(on_failure => sub { 
		my ($self, $csv) = @_;
		warn "Failed on " . $csv->error_input . "\n";
	});

		next if $@;
		next unless $line;
		unless ($csv->parse($line)) {
			$self->call_trigger(on_failure => $csv);
			next;
		}
		my @fields = $csv->fields;
		eval { $self->call_trigger(after_parse => \@fields) };

			@fields = @fields[ $self->want_fields ];
		}
		my $addition = [ @fields ];
		if (my @map = $self->field_map) {
			my $hash = { map { $_ => shift @fields } @map };
			delete $hash->{null};
			$addition = $hash;

=head1 BUGS

This doesn't cope with multi-line fields. Technically the CSV format
allows this, but this is meant to be a ::Simple module, and coping with
that is currently outside the cope of this module.
