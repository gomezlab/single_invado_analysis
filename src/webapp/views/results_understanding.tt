			All of the results from the image processing steps are saved in the zip
			file you downloaded. Several different types of analyses are
			automatically done on each image set, below you will find a few
			instructions on how to find a few of the most common properties
			measured in focal adhesion dynamics experiments.

				<h2>Find Invadopodia Assembly and Disassembly Rates</h2>
				<p>
				The Invadopodia assembly and disassembly rates are stored in the
				file named "ad_kinetics.csv" in the "adhesion_props" folder. These
				results have been filtered to only include adhesions with positive
				rates and p-values of less than 0.05. Four properties are reported
				for each rate:
				<ul> 
					<li>class: Either assembly or disassembly </li> 
					<li>ad_num: This is a unique number assigned to each adhesion
					during the tracking process.</li> 
					<li>slope: This is assembly or disassembly rate calculated
					using the same method as Webb, et al. 2004.</li> 
					<li>adj.r.squared: This is the value of R&sup2 adjusted for the
					lenght of assembly or disassembly phase.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				If you want to dig deeper into the results, visualizations of each
				adhesion and the measurements of the intensity of the adhesion
				marker at each image is also available. You can find the
				visualizations in the "single_ad" folder in "visualizations", where
				each file is named using the same number as appears in the ad_num
				column of the results file. 

				<p>
				You can see a graph of the intensity measurments and the
				corresponding assembly or disassembly phase in the
				Average_adhesion_signal.pdf file in the models directory of
				adhesion_props. In this file, the title of each graph is the same
				number as in the ad_num column.  Finally, if you want the raw
				intensity data, you can look at the Average_adhesion_signal.csv
				file in lin_time_series.  . Each line of the CSV file corresponds
				to a single adhesion, where the line number corresponds to the
				ad_num column.

				<h2>Measure Invadopodia Areas/Intensities</h2>
				<h3>Single Images</h3>
				<p>
				Several different properties are collected about each focal adhesion
				identified by the system. These properites, such as area and intensity
				are stored in two ways: as single measurements associated the adhesions
				in each image and as measurements over time associated with the
				adhesions tracked through time. The single measurements are all in the
				sub-folders of the "individual_pictures" folder, specifically the
				"raw_data" folder. There you will find various csv files such as
				"Area.csv" and "Average_adhesion_signal.csv" which contain area values
				and intensity values respectively. All of the units of distance or area
				are in pixels or square pixels.

				<h3>Time-lapse Image Sets</h3>
				<p>
				Several of sets of properties are also organzied into matrices that
				represent the value of that property over the lifetime of each
				adhesion. In general, the files are organized so that the data from
				each adhesion is present on a single row, with the value of that
				property for each image in the time-series in the columns.  Placeholds
				of NaN are used when an adhesion isn't present in a specfic image.

				<p>
				As an example, consider an adhesion that is born in image 10 and dies
				in frame 20. All the slots before frame 10 will be NaN, while all the
				values after frame 20 will be NaN as well. Columns 10-20 will contain
				the value for that adhesion in the image set.

			<div id=FAAI>
				<h2>Find the Invadopodia Alignment Index (FAAI)</h2>
				<p>
				You can lookup the value of the FAAI in the
				"adhesion_orientation.pdf" file in the "adhesion_props" folder. The
				value of the FAAI is reported in the title of the left hand plot in
				the center row.
			</div>

			<div id=vector_vis>
				<h2>See an Image Like the Front Page Logo</h2>
				<p>
				The same style of visualization for your experiment is available on in
				the "visualizations" folder, look for the ghost files.

				<p>
				The visualization is produced by first converting the binary adhesion
				mask from each image into a vector representation using <a
					href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net/">potrace</a>. Next, each
				vector mask file is colored based on how far into the time-lapse the
				image was taken. The colors start in the blue range, then go up through
				the rainbow color map to red. Finally, all the vector images are
				overlayed and saved as "ghost.svg". This vector image is then converted
				to a small and large png file.
