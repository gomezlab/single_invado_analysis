				<h1>Instructions</h1>
				Thank you for helping to test the focal adhesion analysis webserver.  If you
				encounter any problems, feel free to email me (matthew.berginski [AT]
				gmail.com).
				<h2>Required Options</h2>
				<h3 class="thin">
					Image File
				</h3>
				The program expects that you will submit a grayscale stacked TIFF image set of
				the Invadopodia marker protein. The analysis methods have been tested with a
				wide range of Invadopodia markers including Paxillin, FAK and Vinculin. The
				image set can be of any size, but keep in mind that a large image set can take
				some time to upload.

				<h2>Detection Settings</h2>
				<p/><b>Detection Threshold:</b>This number is used by the adhesion
				detection script to determine when a pixel is or is not part of an adhesion.
				After appling a high pass filter to the images, pixels above this level are
				considered part of an adhesion, while the pixels below are classified as
				background. The lower this number, the more pixels will be classified as part
				of an adhesion.  The default value of two works well in most cases, but values
				down to around one may be appropriate.  Also be aware that lower values will
				lengthen the runtime.  If you want to see what one of your images looks like
				when processed with a specific threshold try out the threshold <a
					href=thresh_testing>tester</a>.

				<p/><b>Don't Split Adjacent Adhesions:</b> This option turns off the wateshed
				segmentation method normally used to split adjacent adhesions. The watershed
				segmentation is the slowest part of the image processing, if this option is
				selected, processing runtimes decrease. You might want to turn on this option
				if the adhesions in your experiments don't appear to touch one another.
				
				<p/><b>Min FA Phase Length:</b> When determining the assembly
				and disassembly rates of the FAs in the image set, the analysis
				methods use log-linear models to determine the value of the
				rates. This setting specifies the minimum number of images that
				the assembly and disassembly phases must be in order to attempt
				to estimate the rates. Decreasing this value allows more
				assembly and disassembly phases to be gathered, but at the cost
				of those phases to potentially be built on fewer data points.

				<p/><b>Min/Max Size:</b> These settings control the
				minimum or maximum adhesion sizes allowed through the
				segmentation step, both are specified in pixels.
				
				<h2>Additional Image Sets</h2>

				<p/><b>Cell Mask:</b> If a set of images are specified as the
				cell mask set, the software will attempt to find the cell body
				from these images. The methods work well in cases where the
				entire body of the cell is expressing a marker and a substantial
				portion of the background is also visible. If such a set of
				images are provided, various properties concerning the adhesions
				and their distance from the cell edge and cell centroid will be
				calculated.

				<h2>Notification Options</h2>
				<h3>Email Address</h3>
				If an email address is provided, you will be notified via email when your job
				finishes processing. Your email address will only be used for notification
				purposes. If this is not provided, then the experiment status page returned on
				submission needs to bookmarked in order to retrieve your results.

				<h3>Note to Self About Experiment</h3>
				Whatever you put in this box will be send back to you in any email the system
				sends concerning your experiment. It is limited to 80 characters.
